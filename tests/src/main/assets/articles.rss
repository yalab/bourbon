<p>JUNE SIMMS: Welcome to AMERICAN MOSAIC in VOA Special English.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>I’m June Simms. This week on our program, we hear new music from Bonnie Raitt...</p>
<p>And we answer a letter from a Chinese man who dreams of being a car designer…</p>
<p>But, first, we take a look at a new movie about Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p><strong>“The Lady”</strong></p>
<p>JUNE SIMMS: French director Luc Besson is famous for his often-violent action films like “La Femme Nikita” and “Taken.” But this week he released a film about a woman of peace. “The Lady” tells the story of Burmese democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi. Christopher Cruise has more on the movie and its star Michelle Yeoh.</p>
<p>CHRISTOPHER CRUISE: Aung San Suu Kyi left her family in England in nineteen eighty-eight for what she thought would be a short visit to help her sick mother in Burma.</p>
<p>(SOUND: “The Lady”)</p>
<p>AUNG SAN SUU KYI (Michelle Yeoh): “It will be hard for me to get to a phone, so don’t worry if it’s a while before you hear from me.”</p>
<p>But she stayed years.</p>
<p>Aung San Suu Kyi, also known as Daw Suu, followed in the political footsteps of her parents. Her father was a national hero in Burma. He led the campaign for independence from Britain in nineteen forty-seven. He was killed by political opponents soon after independence. Her mother was Burma’s Ambassador to India and Nepal when Daw Suu was a teenager.</p>
<p>Daw Suu became the leader of the democracy movement in Burma soon after she returned to her home country.</p>
<p>(SOUND: “The Lady”)</p>
<p>AUNG SAN SUU KYI: “It may be a little late to be saying this, but you realize I’ve never actually spoken in public before.”</p>
<p>MICHAEL (David Thewlis): “Well there’s no time like the present.”</p>
<p>That is David Thewlis playing Daw Suu’s supportive husband Michael Aris, a South Asia culture expert.</p>
<p>Malaysian actor Michelle Yeoh plays Aung San Suu Kyi. She learned to speak Burmese for the part. She says the language was especially important to re-create the first speech Aung San Suu Kyi gave to the Burmese people.</p>
<p><span class="margin-bottom-small display-block container field-note">&lt;!--IMAGE-LEFT--&gt;</span>MICHELLE YEOH: “The first speech that she makes is in Burmese to her people to convince them, and to let them understand, that even though she did marry a foreigner even though she lived outside of Burma for so long, she was her father’s daughter. She can not turn away from what’s happening to her country. And all this is documented in Burmese. So we can’t take liberties and try and do it in English. It just wouldn’t be right.”</p>
<p>(SOUND: “The Lady” in Burmese)</p>
<p>Director Luc Besson found Burmese people to be in the movie’s background scenes. Michelle Yeoh says one of these actors was in a crowd scene for the speech. She says he cried through the entire speech.</p>
<p>MICHELLE YEOH: “We found out that he was there. He said ‘at that time in ‘88, I was in the audience looking up at Daw Suu, hearing her say the speech. Today I am standing behind her listening to her say the speech again.’”</p>
<p>Michelle Yeoh says Luc Besson found many background players who had lived through the events being represented.</p>
<p>MICHELLE YEOH: “He actually went to the Burmese refugee camps up in northern Thailand, and he cast about two hundred of them. All of them were not actors, but they were very natural, of course, I mean they were Burmese. So, the way they moved when they were with me helped me tremendously.”</p>
<p>Burmese officials would not permit “The Lady” to be filmed in Burma. It was shot in Thailand instead.</p>
<p>(SOUND: “The Lady”)</p>
<p>BURMESE OFFICIAL: “Madame, your restricted residence is at an end. You are now free to come and go as you please.”</p>
<p>Aung San Suu Kyi was freed from house arrest in twenty-ten. The movie is being released as the democracy leader is elected to parliament in a reforming Burma.</p>
<p><strong>Car Designer Dreams</strong></p>
<p>JUNE SIMMS: A young man in China has written to our relationship blog for advice about his career. The twenty-six year old studied automobile engineering and completed his university education last year. But, he has discovered his professional dream is to be a car designer. Right now he is working as an engineer at a carmaker, Ford. He wants to know how to make a career change.</p>
<p>We found someone who might be able to help. Anthony Prozzi is a senior designer at Ford in Michigan. He has been with the company for twelve years. But, he started his career in clothing design. Before he left to study car design, he worked for the menswear department of Donna Karan in New York.</p>
<p>Mr. Prozzi knows about change. His first college experience took him to New York University.</p>
<p>ANTHONY PROZZI: “I excelled in math and science. I attended New York University with the intention of becoming a doctor.”</p>
<p>But he says fashion always interested him. His mother was employed in the garment industry and he would watch her at work.</p>
<p>ANTHONY PROZZI: “I was just fascinated by the craft. Even as a kid I would make clothes for my GI Joe.”</p>
<p>To help support himself during college, Anthony Prozzi started working in the fashion design industry. He fell in love with that world and left NYU. After some time, he decided he needed a formal design education. He attended classes at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York. While there he met Carl Olsen, a Pratt graduate, who was now the chair of transportation design at the Center for Creative Studies in Detroit, Michigan.</p>
<p>ANTHONY PROZZI: “He looked at my work and he’s like, ‘what are you doing here. You should doing cars and transportation.”</p>
<p><span class="margin-bottom-small display-block container field-note">&lt;!--IMAGE-RIGHT--&gt;</span>So Mr. Prozzi moved to Detroit and started studying at the Center for Creative Studies. The day he graduated he was offered a job in car design. He accepted and a few years later went to Ford Motor Company.</p>
<p>Mr. Prozzi says the young man in China should follow his heart.</p>
<p>ANTHONY PROZZI: “My advice to him is to take that leap of faith and find a great school. Send them your portfolio. Because the advisers there will guide him and be able to really nourish the talent that his has within. Because he has an engineering background that gives him an edge, because he’ll understand how things come together.”</p>
<p>Mr. Prozzi says he was very excited about being back in school, and exchanging ideas with people who shared his interests. And he loves car design, like our writer.</p>
<p>ANTHONY PROZZI: “He sort of said this in his letter, that, when he sketches, it’s very liberating. And the whole process of designing and creating, there’s a freedom involved in that. You really almost lose yourself in the process.”</p>
<p>We hope that helps our writer from China chases his car design career. And we hope you all keep writing to our relationship blog at voaspecialenglish.com. You can also send us an email to <a href="mailto:mosaic@voanews.com">mosaic@voanews.com</a>. Put relationship in the subject line and tells us you age, sex and country.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p><strong>Bonnie Raitt “Slipstream”</strong></p>
<p>JUNE SIMMS: Musician Bonnie Raitt is back after a long break from recording. Her new album, “Slipstream” comes seven years after her last release. But, her voice and guitar sound as sure as ever.</p>
<p>Shirley Griffith plays some of the new music and brings us up to date about the performer.</p>
<p>SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: Bonnie Raitt’s recording career began in nineteen seventy-one with her album, “Bonnie Raitt.” She was just twenty-two years old. Critics immediately recognized her great singing skills and guitar work. She was good at blues, rock, and country.</p>
<p><span class="margin-bottom-small display-block container field-note">&lt;!--IMAGE-LEFT--&gt;</span>Forty years later, Bonnie Raitt still sounds pure and fresh. And she can give old songs new life like no one else. “Slipstream” includes a version of a song by Gerry Rafferty from nineteen seventy-eight. Raitt adds a reggae beat to “Right Down the Line,” for a thoroughly modern sound.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>Two Bob Dylan songs can also be found on “Slipstream.” One is the bluesy “Million Miles.” The other is this heartbreaking love song, “Standing in the Doorway.”</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>“Slipstream” is the first release on Bonnie Raitt’s own label, Redwing Records. She told the New York Times that it was best to record on her own terms. “I like to have my freedom,” she said. She shares production credit with her friend, producer and songwriter, Joe Henry. (MUSIC: “You Can’t Fail Me Now”)</p>
<p>Bonnie Raitt is well known for her slide guitar work. We leave you with an excellent example, “Ain't Gonna Let You Go,” from “Slipstream.”</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>JUNE SIMMS: I’m June Simms. Our program was written and produced by Caty Weaver. Join us again next week for music and more on AMERICAN MOSAIC in VOA Special English.</p>

<p>This is the VOA Special English Economics Report.</p>
<p>The United States says technology company Apple and book publishers illegally fixed prices of electronic books, or e-books. The Department of Justice took legal action on Wednesday in federal court in New York City.</p>
<p>The same day, Attorney General Eric Holder spoke in Washington about the case against Apple and the book publishers. The publishers are Hachette, HarperCollins, MacMillan, Penguin and Simon &amp; Schuster.</p>
<p>Mr. Holder said e-books are changing the way Americans share information. He said the Department of Justice wants to make sure Americans can buy e-books at a fair price. He said the case was part of that effort.</p>
<p>ERIC HOLDER: “As part of this commitment, the Department has reached a settlement with three of the nation’s largest book publishers – and will continue to litigate against Apple, and two additional leading publishers – for conspiring to increase the prices that consumers pay for e-books.”</p>
<p>The Justice Department says Apple and the five publishers made an illegal deal to set higher prices for electronic books. It says, because of this, Americans paid millions of dollars more than they should have.</p>
<p>The dispute centers on the influence of Amazon.com. The Internet store had been selling e-books for nine dollars and ninety-nine cents. But the government says Apple made a deal with the publishers two years ago as it prepared to launch the iPad tablet computer. The deal guaranteed Apple thirty percent of the money earned on each e-book sold. It also created a pricing model that required stores to sell at a price set by the publishers and Apple. The price was several dollars higher than the one offered by Amazon.</p>
<p>Acting Assistant Attorney General Sharis Pozen noted that businesses can set their own prices. But she also said:</p>
<p>SHARIS POZEN: “Let me be clear, when companies get together and conspire to enter into agreements that eliminate price competition, it crosses the line.  This kind of agreement is illegal and anticompetitive.  That’s when the Antitrust Division will take action, and that’s what we’ve done today.”</p>
<p>Sharis Pozen added that company officials knew what they were doing at the time. That included former Apple chief Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>Antitrust laws aim to halt business methods that crush competition. Hachette, HarperCollins and Simon &amp; Schuster have agreed to a settlement. It says they must repay millions of dollars and stop giving Apple special treatment.</p>
<p>Sixteen states and Puerto Rico are also bringing their own case. Apple and British publishers McMillan and Penguin have decided to go to court.</p>

<p>STEVE EMBER: Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION – American history in VOA Special English. I'm Steve Ember.</p>
<p>GEORGE W. BUSH: "Trusting in the sanity and restraint of Saddam Hussein is not a strategy, and it is not an option. [Applause]"</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>This week in our series, we look at the American-led invasion of Iraq in March two thousand three. It was part of the “War on Terror” President George W. Bush had declared after the al-Qaida attacks on the United States on September eleventh, two thousand one.</p>
<p>In October of that year, the United States led the invasion of Afghanistan. The purpose was to attack al-Qaida and the Taliban rulers sheltering the group's leader, Osama bin Laden.</p>
<p>At the same time, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was proposing the possibility of military action against Iraq as well. American officials accused Iraq of supporting terrorism. They pointed out that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had used chemical weapons on his own people. They said there were signs that he was also trying to develop biological and nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>President Bush gave his annual State of the Union message to Congress in January two thousand two.</p>
<p>He described American successes in closing terrorist training camps in Afghanistan. He also spoke of cooperation from Pakistan toward the same goal in that country.</p>
<p>The president singled out three countries -- North Korea, Iran and Iraq -- as what he called an "axis of evil."</p>
<p>He said the United States would not wait to be attacked by terrorist groups or the nations that support them.</p>
<p>GEORGE W. BUSH: "Our second goal is to prevent regimes that sponsor terror from threatening America or our friends and allies with weapons of mass destruction. Some of these regimes have been pretty quiet since September the eleventh. But we know their true nature. North Korea is a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction, while starving its citizens.</p>
<p>"Iran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror, while an unelected few repress the Iranian people's hope for freedom.</p>
<p>"Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror. The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax, and nerve gas, and nuclear weapons for over a decade. This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens — leaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children. This is a regime that agreed to international inspections — then kicked out the inspectors. This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilized world."</p>
<p>And President Bush had this warning:</p>
<p><span class="margin-bottom-small display-block container field-note">&lt;!--IMAGE-LEFT--&gt;</span>GEORGE W. BUSH: "States like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred.”</p>
<p>President Bush said that the United States would not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten U.S. security with the world's most destructive weapons.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>Iraq had been defeated in nineteen ninety-one after it invaded Kuwait. The United Nations ordered Iraq to destroy all of its development efforts for nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. The U.N. had sent teams of weapons inspectors to make sure Iraq was following its resolutions. But since nineteen ninety-eight, Iraq had refused to let U.N. weapons inspection teams into the country.</p>
<p>President Bush and his administration argued that Iraq was making or hiding weapons of mass destruction, known as WMDs.  He said if the United Nations failed to force Iraq to disarm, the United States might launch a military attack against the country.</p>
<p>In September two thousand two, a year after the attacks on New York and Washington, Bush addressed the U.N. General Assembly.</p>
<p>GEORGE W. BUSH: “We know that Saddam Hussein pursued weapons of mass murder even before inspectors were in his country. Are we to assume that he stopped when they left?”</p>
<p>With that speech he began making a case to the international community for an invasion of Iraq.</p>
<p><span class="margin-bottom-small display-block container field-note">&lt;!--IMAGE-LEFT--&gt;</span>GEORGE W. BUSH: "The history, the logic, and the facts lead to one conclusion – Saddam Hussein’s regime is a grave and gathering danger. To suggest otherwise is to hope against the evidence. To assume this regime’s good faith is to bet the lives of millions and the peace of the world in a reckless gamble. And this is a risk we must not take.”</p>
<p>Back in Washington, the president asked Congress to pass a resolution giving him power to use military force against Iraq.  Congress approved the resolution in October.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>In November, Iraq agreed to permit U.N. weapons inspectors to return. After more inspections, the leader of the team reported back to the United Nations in February two thousand three. He said the team had found no evidence of weapons of mass destruction. But he also said Iraq was not cooperating with efforts to find out if suspected weapons had been destroyed and if weapons programs had ended.</p>
<p>DONALD RUMSFELD: “The United States knows that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction. Any country on the face of the earth that has an active intelligence program knows that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction.”</p>
<p>Donald Rumsfeld was not alone in supporting the idea of a war against Iraq.</p>
<p>DICK CHENEY: “There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction ... "</p>
<p>Other supporters included Vice President Dick Cheney.</p>
<p>DICK CHENEY: “that he is amassing them to use against our friends, against our allies and against us.”</p>
<p>And "neocons," or members of the neoconservative movement.</p>
<p>In January of two thousand three, President Bush used his State of the Union speech to strengthen his case against Iraq.</p>
<p>GEORGE W. BUSH: “Year after year, Saddam Hussein has gone to elaborate lengths, spent enormous sums, taken great risks to build and keep weapons of mass destruction. But why? The only possible explanation, the only possible use he could have for those weapons, is to dominate, intimidate, or attack.”</p>
<p>He said British intelligence reported that Saddam Hussein had tried to buy uranium from Africa. Uranium can be used to make nuclear weapons. Several months later, the White House said the intelligence was false.</p>
<p>The president wanted the United Nations to approve military force against Iraq. Britain and Spain also supported military action. They asked the Security Council to pass a resolution approving military action against Iraq. But some of the countries on the fifteen-member Security Council were opposed. They included Germany, France and Russia. They said inspections should be increased and that the use of force should only be a last choice. The United States withdrew the resolution.</p>
<p>The United States and Britain decided on a plan to invade Iraq. There was strong support among Americans. But there was widespread international opposition. In February two thousand three, millions of people in hundreds of cities around the world took part in anti-war protests. Opponents argued that the United States would be violating international law by invading a nation that they said was not an immediate threat.</p>
<p>There was no evidence that Iraq was involved in the 9-11 attacks. But President Bush said he wanted to prevent Saddam Hussein from supplying weapons of mass destruction to terrorist groups that might attack the United States or other countries.</p>
<p>GEORGE W. BUSH: “Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised. This regime has already used weapons of mass destruction against Iraq's neighbors and against Iraq's people.</p>
<p>“The regime has a history of reckless aggression in the Middle East. It has a deep hatred of America and our friends and it has aided, trained and harbored terrorists, including operatives of Al Qaeda.”</p>
<p>He also argued that the Iraqi leader was an evil dictator who had ordered the killing of thousands of people and should be removed from power.</p>
<p>Bush made his intentions clear in a televised speech on March seventeenth two thousand three.</p>
<p>GEORGE W. BUSH: “The United Nations Security Council has not lived up to its responsibilities, so we will rise to ours. In recent days, some governments in the Middle East have been doing their part. They have delivered public and private messages urging the dictator to leave Iraq, so that disarmament can proceed peacefully. He has thus far refused.”</p>
<p>And President Bush told Saddam Hussein and his sons to leave Iraq or face military action.</p>
<p>GEORGE W. BUSH: “All the decades of deceit and cruelty have now reached an end. Saddam Hussein and his sons must leave Iraq within 48 hours. Their refusal to do so will result in military conflict, commenced at a time of our choosing.”</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>The Iraqi leader rejected the demand. U.N. inspection teams had requested more time to complete their job. But they left Iraq four days before the American-led invasion began on March twentieth.</p>
<p>(SOUND: Invasion of Iraq)</p>
<p>GEORGE W. BUSH: “At this hour, American and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm Iraq, to free its people, and to defend the world from grave danger.”</p>
<p>On March twentieth, Iraqi time, air strikes by the United States and Britain began what was called "Operation Iraqi Freedom."  The United States said the war was meant to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, end Saddam Hussein's support for terrorism and free the Iraqi people. A number of other countries joined the war effort.</p>
<p>The coalition quickly defeated the Iraqi military. On April ninth, United States forces took control of Baghdad.  Iraqis and American forces destroyed a large statue of Saddam Hussein in the capital.</p>
<p>The allies controlled all major Iraqi cities. Saddam Hussein had disappeared into hiding.</p>
<p>(SOUND: Bush's plane landing on carrier deck)</p>
<p>On May first, President Bush was flown to the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln to make an announcement.</p>
<p>GEORGE W. BUSH: "Thank you all very much.  Admiral Kelly, Captain Card, officers and sailors of the USS Abraham Lincoln, my fellow Americans, major combat operations in Iraq have ended. In the battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed. [Applause.]"</p>
<p>In the background there was a banner reading "Mission Accomplished."</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>The government in Baghdad had fallen. But a deepening conflict in Iraq lay ahead.     American troops and an American inspection team searched Iraq for weapons of mass destruction. But none were found.  The intelligence used to justify the invasion had turned out to be wrong. Intelligence failures happen. But some Americans felt that they had been misled by the administration in its push to go to war against Iraq.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)<br /> The United States turned its attention to rebuilding Iraq and establishing a new Iraqi government.  The Coalition Provisional Authority was created as a temporary government in Iraq. President Bush replaced a general with State Department official Paul Bremer as head of the authority.</p>
<p>People rioted and stole from government buildings, museums and banks. In many places there was little or no electric power, running water or trash collection.</p>
<p>The Coalition Provisional Authority dismissed the Iraqi army and the government. Those people now had no jobs.</p>
<p>The presence of foreigners in their country angered many Iraqis.  Militants attacked coalition troops. They also attacked Iraqis and international organizations seen as cooperating with American forces.  In some areas, longtime religious differences between Sunni and Shiite Muslims grew into armed disputes.</p>
<p>ROBERT RIGGS (EMBEDDED REPORTER): “Today marks the third day of our road march toward Baghdad."</p>
<p>The invasion of Iraq was the most closely reported war in military history. At the start of the war, as many as seven hundred reporters and photographers were embedded with the troops, living and traveling with them. Also, blogs gave people the ability to immediately read what troops were writing about the war from the front lines.</p>
<p>SOLDIER: “I’m just glad to be a part of something like this, that’s hopefully going to free a lot of people that are oppressed, and get a madman out of power, too.”</p>
<p><span class="margin-bottom-small display-block container field-note">&lt;!--IMAGE-RIGHT--&gt;</span>In December two thousand three, United States forces captured Saddam Hussein. He was hiding in a hole on a farm near Tikrit. He was later tried by Iraqis for crimes against his people and hanged. But that did not mean the war in Iraq would end anytime soon.</p>
<p>George Bush became a war president. He had two wars in lead as commander in chief, one in Afghanistan and the other in Iraq. But he also had matters of domestic policy to deal with as chief executive in Washington. That will be our story next week.</p>

<p>This is the VOA Special English Education Report.</p>
<p>Graduate schools in the United States are reporting a nine percent increase in applications from international students this year. The increase is the same as two years ago. Last year's gain was eleven percent.</p>
<p>China, Mexico and Brazil showed the biggest increases in applications to enter master's and doctoral programs this fall.</p>
<p>Engineering is the top area of study for international students and had the biggest increase in applications. Gains in business and physical and earth sciences were close behind. Life sciences showed no growth in the <a href="http://www.cgsnet.org/international-graduate-applications-rise-seventh-consecutive-year-china-mexico-and-brazil-show-large">latest survey</a> by the Council of Graduate Schools.</p>
<p>The survey includes the top five countries that send graduate students to the United States, plus Mexico and Brazil. The top five are China, India, South Korea, Taiwan and Canada.</p>
<p>Applications from China climbed eighteen percent this year. That was down from last year. India's number increased just two percent. Applications from South Korea and Taiwan decreased by one to two percent.</p>
<p>Applications from Africa were down five percent, while the Middle East and Europe showed growth.</p>
<p>Council President  Debra Stewart says final results will not be available until the summer.</p>
<p>DEBRA STEWART: "Remember, applications do not necessarily convert to enrollment. So about forty-seven percent of all international applications to U.S. graduate schools actually come from students from China. But the share of the applicant pool that actually ends up enrolling in U.S. graduate programs is a bit lower though their application numbers were considerably higher."</p>
<p>Ms. Stewart says last fall, for example, twenty-nine percent of all international graduate students were from China.</p>
<p>This year is the seventh year of big increases in applications from China, where Ms. Stewart points out that more and more students are finishing college.</p>
<p>DEBRA STEWART: "There are just a huge number of talented students, the number growing ever year, because of the tremendous growth in the undergraduate population in China. Now, China has felt the recession like the rest of the world has felt the recession. So it certainly is possible that these very exceptionally strong numbers could be a reflection of recession experiences in China, as well."</p>
<p>George Ofosu from Ghana is working toward a doctorate in political science at the University of California, Los Angeles. He says he was attracted to UCLA's coursework, libraries and other resources, including financial aid he would not have had at home.</p>
<p>GEORGE OSOFU: "It was an ideal opportunity for me to go through the system and get admission here. One, get the training and, two, get some funding to pursue the studies. So I think, yeah, the experience here is really phenomenal."</p>
<p>And that's the VOA Special English Education Report, written by Jerilyn Watson.  I'm Christopher Cruise.</p>

<p>This is the VOA Special English Health Report.</p>
<p>In the past year, Burma has opened its political system and reached cease-fire agreements with some ethnic militias. The government has also eased media restrictions. But many aid groups say their jobs have not gotten any easier.</p>
<p>Health workers are warning about the spread of a form of drug-resistant malaria. The malaria is resistant to treatment with artemisinin. It was first seen several years ago in Cambodia.</p>
<p>Frank Smithuis started a group called Medical Action Myanmar. He says even with the recent political openings, aid organizations still find it difficult to gain access to areas most in need of aid. This is true, he says, especially in areas torn by many years of conflict along Burma's eastern border.</p>
<p><span class="field-note container display-block margin-bottom-small">&lt;!--IMAGE-LEFT--&gt;</span>FRANK SMITHUIS: "There are now very good opportunities because of the cease-fire agreements with the Karen and the Mon. Larger areas should now be open for access to a joint activity to stop this artemisinin resistance spread. However that has not happened yet and we definitely need to have more openness and more activity and more international donor money. And that’s very, very important."</p>
<p>In the past, many nongovernmental organizations simply worked without official approval. Lower-level government officials largely ignored organizations that did not follow the rules.</p>
<p>Until two thousand nine, just three international nongovernmental aid organizations had the required approvals to operate inside Burma. Yet more than one hundred were operating there. Many were able to get a memorandum of understanding that allowed them to work without an official registration.</p>
<p>But then came the recent political changes. Heads of aid organizations say lower-level officials are now unclear about their powers and responsibilities. In many cases they are enforcing the requirements more closely.</p>
<p>Save the Children is an aid organization whose work is mostly related to mother and child health in Burma. Kelland Stevenson with Save the Children says, in general, ministries and government workers have become much more cooperative. He agrees with those who say the barriers that humanitarian workers now face are largely bureaucratic.</p>
<p>KELLAND STEVENSON: "It shouldn’t be a political discussion. There remains a bit of command and control from government, and it's not going to open up overnight. And the discussion about getting access to new areas is under way. You have to remember these changes have been extraordinarily dramatic in such a short time. I mean, we're talking a year."</p>
<p>Kelland Stevenson says "things are changing so quickly." Still, aid groups warn that some issues -- such as the drug-resistant malaria -- may only get worse unless the government also takes action quickly.</p>

<p>STEVE EMBER: I’m Steve Ember.</p>
<p>BARBARA KLEIN: And I’m Barbara Klein with EXPLORATIONS in VOA Special English. Today we tell about a large national park established to protect the culture of ancient Native Americans. It is called Mesa Verde.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>STEVE EMBER: It was cold that day in eighteen eighty-eight in southwestern Colorado. Richard Wetherill and his brother-in-law were trying to find some missing cattle. They were up on Mesa Verde. Spanish explorers had named the area. The high, flat mountaintop is covered with many green juniper and pinon pine trees. It looks like a huge green table, which is “mesa verde” in Spanish.</p>
<p>The two men came to the edge of a deep canyon. Through the falling snow, they saw what looked like a small city across the canyon. It was suspended in the middle of the rock wall. There were many connected rooms built into a natural opening in the rock.</p>
<p>They named the ruins Cliff Palace. In the next few days, they found two more large ruins. They named one Spruce Tree House. They named the other Square Tower House.</p>
<p>BARBARA KLEIN: A number of other people had seen and taken pictures of some of the cliff dwellings earlier. But the Wetherill family was the first group to study them. Soon after his discovery, Richard Wetherill returned to Mesa Verde, to the ruins that had remained silent and untouched for centuries.</p>
<p>Richard Wetherill collected many objects. It was an easy task. It looked as if the people who had lived there had just walked away, leaving everything they owned. Cooking pots by the fireplaces. Food bowls on the floors. Shoes in the corners. Sticks for digging by the doors.</p>
<p>The ruins in Colorado had been home to the ancestors of the present day members of the Pueblo tribes. They were named Anasazi, or ancient ones, by the Navajo Indians. They moved to Mesa Verde about one thousand five hundred years ago and left seven hundred years ago. They built the cliff dwellings in Mesa Verde toward the end of the eight hundred years they lived there.</p>
<p>STEVE EMBER: Richard Wetherill showed his collection of objects in nearby towns. People were not interested. Just some more old Indian things, they said. Finally, he sold his collection to the Colorado Historical Society. But the Wetherill family continued exploring Mesa Verde. Their finds became known in the eastern United States and in Europe. Hundreds of people went to Mesa Verde to see for themselves.</p>
<p>BARBARA KLEIN: One of the earliest visitors was a young man from Sweden, Gustaf Nordenskiold. Mister Nordenskiold spent months exploring the area. He traveled on foot and on horseback. He took pictures that were published in a book, “The Cliff Dwellers of the Mesa Verde.”</p>
<p>Gustaf Nordenskiold collected hundreds of objects he found in the ruins. He loaded them on teams of mules and sent them to the nearby town of Durango, Colorado. Local officials tried to prevent him from removing so many objects. But there were no laws to stop him. Mister Nordenskiold shipped the objects to Sweden. Later, they were given to the national museum in Helsinki, Finland, where they remain today.</p>
<p>STEVE EMBER: Many people were shocked by the continuing removal of objects from the ruins at Mesa Verde. One was a woman named Virginia McClurg. She had visited the area and had explored a few small ruins. From eighteen eighty-seven to eighteen ninety-six, she campaigned throughout the country to get laws to save the cliff dwellings. She gave speeches describing the destruction of the dwellings by people seeking treasures. She worked for years with members of the United States Congress to get such laws passed.</p>
<p>Finally, on June twenty-ninth, nineteen-six, President Theodore Roosevelt signed a bill creating Mesa Verde National Park. It was the first National Park designed to protect the works of humans. Then Congress approved the Federal Antiquities Act of nineteen-six. The act helps protect ancient ruins on federal lands.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>BARBARA KLEIN: Today, from a distance, Mesa Verde appears as it did centuries ago. It rises more than five hundred forty meters above the floor of the valley. Visitors can drive up to the top of Mesa Verde on a winding mountain road. When you reach the top, you are two thousand four hundred meters above sea level. In the distance are the flat lands and mountains of the Four Corners area. That is where the western states of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Arizona meet. This area has one of the largest numbers of archeological sites in the United States.</p>
<p>STEVE EMBER: Within the national park are more than five thousand ruins from the time of the Ancestral Puebloan people. Six hundred are cliff dwellings. Most of the ruins remain unexplored. Some have been uncovered and supported to make them safe to visit. These ruins are open to the public during most of the year. During the winter, activities are limited. The visitors' center at the park is open during the summer. The museum is open all year.</p>
<p>The visitors’ center and the museum provide information about the history of the culture of the ancient Pueblo people and about present-day Indians. National Park Service guides lead visitors to the ruins. They give talks about the cultural history of the area. And they talk about the geology and wildlife.</p>
<p>BARBARA KLEIN: Some of the ruins in the Four Corners area are from the earliest people who lived there. They were hunters and gatherers, now known as Basket Makers. The Basket Makers lived in simple caves. Their civilization existed two thousand years ago. The first evidence that ancient people had moved to Mesa Verde is from about the year five hundred. Those people lived in pit houses. Pit houses were large holes in the ground with roofs of wood and mud.</p>
<p>In about the year seven hundred fifty, the early Pueblo people began building square structures of large connected rooms, or pueblos, above ground. Finally, in about eleven hundred, they climbed down the canyon walls and began building cliff dwellings. Today, visitors to Mesa Verde can see some of the remains of all four kinds of settlements.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>STEVE EMBER: Cliff Palace is the largest cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde and also in North America. It has one hundred fifty rooms. It is difficult to get to it. Visitors must climb down into the canyon on a narrow path with many steps. They must also climb down several ladders. But the trip is well worth the effort. Visitors can examine a huge and beautiful structure made of stone and clay.</p>
<p>Spruce Tree House is the third largest cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde National Park. It has one hundred fourteen rooms. It also has eight underground rooms called kivas. The Indian men gathered in the kivas for special ceremonies. About one hundred people lived in this cliff dwelling during the thirteenth century.</p>
<p>Spruce Tree House is the easiest cliff dwelling to visit. The path curves down into the valley and then up to the ruin. Signs along the path point to trees and plants used by the Ancestral Puebloan people. Also along the path are the juniper and pinon pine trees that make Mesa Verde green.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>BARBARA KLEIN: About five hundred thousand people visit Mesa Verde National Park each year. The park’s archeologists have recovered many objects that the ancient Pueblo people used, including pots, tools and jewelry. Many of the objects are shown in the visitors’ center. However, human remains or any object from a grave may not be touched or shown. This is to honor the wishes of the modern Puebloan people who live in the area today.</p>
<p>Mesa Verde National Park occupies twenty-one thousand hectares of land. However, only about ten percent of the area has been explored.</p>
<p>STEVE EMBER: Mesa Verde is recognized as a special place. The United Nations named it one of the first World Heritage sites in nineteen seventy-eight. Special events were held at Mesa Verde during its one hundredth anniversary in two thousand six. They included tours of areas never before open to the public.</p>
<p>Today's Pueblo Indians whose ancestors lived in Mesa Verde consider it a sacred place. And for visitors from around the world, it remains a place of mystery and beauty.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>

<p>BARBARA KLEIN: This is SCIENCE IN THE NEWS in VOA Special English. I'm Barbara Klein.</p>
<p>BOB DOUGHTY: And I'm Bob Doughty. This week, we explore the science of tornadoes. These violent storms strike in many parts of the world but happen most commonly in the United States.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>BARBARA KLEIN: Tornado season has begun in the United States.</p>
<p>Last Tuesday a series of storms tore across the Dallas-Fort Worth area in Texas. The tornadoes damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes. Yet no deaths were reported.</p>
<p>On March second, more than forty tornadoes moved through the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, and the South. Reports say the storms killed at least thirty-nine people in five states.</p>
<p>A tornado is a violently turning tube of air suspended from a thick cloud. It extends from a thunderstorm in the sky down to the ground. The shape is like a funnel: wide at the top, narrower at the bottom.</p>
<p><span class="margin-bottom-small display-block container field-note">&lt;!--IMAGE-RIGHT--&gt;</span>Tornadoes form when winds blowing in different directions meet in the clouds and begin to turn in circles. Warm air rising from below causes the wind tube to reach toward the ground. Because of their circular movement, these windstorms are also known as twisters.</p>
<p>The most severe tornadoes can reach wind speeds of three hundred twenty kilometers an hour or more. In some cases, the resulting paths of damage can stretch more than a kilometer wide and eighty kilometers long.</p>
<p>BOB DOUGHTY: With a tornado, bigger does not necessarily mean stronger. Large tornadoes can be weak. And some of the smallest tornadoes can be the most damaging. But no matter what the size, tornado winds are the strongest on Earth. Tornadoes have been known to carry trees, cars or homes from one place to another. They can also destroy anything in their path.</p>
<p>Tornadoes have been observed on every continent except Antarctica. But experts say they are most commonly seen in the United States. On average, more than one thousand are reported nationwide each year.</p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration keeps records of tornado sightings. It says tornadoes kill seventy people and injure one thousand five hundred others nationwide in an average year.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>BARBARA KLEIN: Tornadoes are observed most often in the middle of the United States, where the land is mostly flat. The area where the most violent tornadoes usually happen is known as “Tornado Alley.” This area is considered to extend from north central Texas to North Dakota.</p>
<p>Tornadoes can happen any time of the year. But most happen from late winter to the middle of summer. In some areas, there is a second high season in autumn.</p>
<p>BOB DOUGHTY: Tornado seasons are the result of wind and weather patterns. During spring, warm air moves north and mixes with cold air remaining from winter. In autumn, the opposite happens. Cold weather moves south and combines with the last of the warm air from summer.</p>
<p><span class="margin-bottom-small display-block container field-note">&lt;!--IMAGE-RIGHT--&gt;</span>Tornadoes can strike with little or no warning. Most injuries happen when flying objects hit people. Experts say the best place to be is in an underground shelter, or a small, windowless room in the lowest part of a building.</p>
<p>People driving during a tornado are told to find low ground and lay flat, facedown, with their hands covering their head. People in the path of a tornado often just have minutes to make life-or-death decisions.</p>
<p>BARBARA KLEIN: The deadliest American tornado on record was the Tri-State Tornado of March eighteenth, nineteen twenty-five. It tore across Missouri, Illinois and Indiana. About seven hundred people were killed.</p>
<p>Between March and May of last year, there were one thousand one hundred fifty-nine confirmed tornadoes across the United States. Scientists say that is the most on record for any three-month period. The most active month was last April, when seven hundred fifty-eight tornadoes were confirmed. That is the most ever for any month.</p>
<p>Last April, the country also broke a thirty-seven year old record for the largest tornado outbreak. A "tornado outbreak" is often defined as six or more tornadoes produced by the same weather system within a day.</p>
<p>Scientists say the one hundred ninety-nine tornadoes on April twenty-seventh were the most for any single day. They say the storms killed three hundred sixteen people – the most ever in modern records for a twenty-four hour period.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>BOB DOUGHTY: No two tornadoes look exactly the same. And no two tornadoes act the same way.</p>
<p>Even a weak tornado requires the right combination of wind, temperature, pressure and humidity. Weather experts can identify these conditions. And, when they observe them, they can advise people that tornadoes might develop. But they are not able to tell exactly where or when a tornado will hit. Tornado warnings still depend in large part on human observations.</p>
<p>Usually a community will receive a warning at least a few minutes before a tornado strikes. But each year there are some surprises where tornadoes develop when they are least expected.</p>
<p>BARBARA KLEIN: The tornado reporting system involves watches and warnings. A tornado watch means tornadoes are possible in the area. A tornado warning means that a tornado has been seen. People are told to take shelter immediately.</p>
<p>Yet tornadoes can be difficult to see. Sometimes only the objects they are carrying through the air can be seen. Some night-time tornadoes have been observed because of lightning strikes nearby. But tornadoes at night are usually impossible to see.</p>
<p>Tornadoes that form over water are called waterspouts. But tornadoes cover a much smaller area than hurricanes, which form over oceans.</p>
<p>Tornadoes can be measured using wind speed information from Doppler radar systems. Tornadoes usually travel in a northeasterly direction with a speed of thirty-two to sixty-four kilometers an hour. But they have been reported to move in other directions and as fast as one hundred seventeen kilometers an hour.</p>
<p>BOB DOUGHTY: In the United States, the force of a tornado is judged by the damage to structures. Scientists inspect the damage before they estimate the severity of a tornado. They measure tornadoes on the Enhanced Fujita scale or the EF scale.</p>
<p>Ted Fujita was a weather expert who developed a system to rate tornados in the nineteen seventies. The EF scale is a set, or collection, of wind estimates. They are based on levels of damage to twenty-eight different kinds of structures and other objects. Tornadoes that cause only light damage are called an EF-zero. Those with the highest winds that destroy well-built homes and throw vehicles great distances are called an EF-five.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>BARBARA KLEIN: Some people make a sport out of watching and following tornadoes. They are called tornado chasers or storm chasers. Their work can be seen in the extreme weather videos that are increasingly popular on television and on the Internet.</p>
<p>Some chasers do it just because it is their idea of fun. Others do it to help document storms and warn the public. Still others are part of weather research teams.</p>
<p>Two years ago, an international team of scientists completed a tornado research project called VORTEX2. More than one hundred researchers traveled throughout America’s Great Plains in two thousand nine and two thousand ten. They used weather measurement instruments to collect scientific information about the life of a tornado. The goal of the project was to examine in detail how tornadoes are formed and the kinds of damage they cause.</p>
<p>Last year, a film about the VORTEX2 project was released. The film includes never before seen images of tornadoes. To safely capture up-close film footage of tornadoes, some project participants traveled in a seven-ton, armored tornado intercept vehicle directly into tornadoes as they formed.</p>
<p>BOB DOUGHTY:<strong> </strong>The National Weather Service says the United States gets more severe weather than any other country. For one thing, it is also bigger than most other countries. And it has many different conditions that create many different kinds of weather.</p>
<p>There are seacoasts and deserts, flatlands and mountains. The West Coast is along the Pacific Ocean, which is relatively calm. The East Coast is along the Atlantic Ocean, which is known for its hurricanes. These strike mainly the southeastern states.</p>

<p>This is the VOA Special English Agriculture Report.</p>
<p>A new report says if women farmers had the same rights as men, more could be done to reduce world hunger. The report, "Empowering Women in Agriculture," is from the anti-hunger group Bread for the World. Bread for the World says equal access to agricultural resources would help increase food security and economic growth.</p>
<p>Faustine Wabwire is the group's foreign assistance specialist.</p>
<p>FAUSTINE WABMIRE: "Women constituted half of the agricultural labor force in not just Africa, but the developing countries as a whole. And when you think of Africa alone, it's more than sixty percent of the total agricultural labor force being provided by women."</p>
<p>The report says in most countries, women working in rural areas are more likely than men to hold seasonal, part-time and low-wage jobs. They also receive less pay for the same work.</p>
<p>Ms. Wabwire says women farmers often cannot get seeds, fertilizer, proper tools, credit and, especially, land.</p>
<p>FAUSTINE WABWIRE: "For most of Africa, we have about eighty percent of the population living in rural areas and they subsist on agriculture. Now women make sixty percent of the agricultural labor force and they have no access to resources. So, for example, land is one good example where less than twenty percent of all landholders are women."</p>
<p>This is often because of legal as well as cultural reasons. She says women who have lost their husbands may have no legal rights over their land. The only way to keep the land, she says, is to marry, say, the brother of the dead husband.</p>
<p>FAUSTINE WABWIRE: "So constraints like this are still very prevalent in most African societies and they continue to impede women's ability to fully enjoy their human rights."</p>
<p>However, Ms. Wabwire says women in agriculture are getting more attention these days. For example, Kenya's new constitution gives women the right to own land. But she says there is still a long way to go. Bread for the World is urging the United States government to increase development assistance, or at least not to decrease it.</p>
<p>FAUSTINE WABWIRE: "This assistance through programs such as Feed the Future, which is the U.S. government's agriculture program, is helping to elevate the status of women. It's enabling women to access productive resources such as seeds. They are able to have access to extension services, which will enable them to produce more and contribute to healthy societies."</p>
<p>But Ms. Wabwire says more African governments must recognize the major role that women play in agriculture and elsewhere. The report says, "Putting more income in the hands of women translates into improved child nutrition, health, and education." It gives women a way to "transform the economic life of the communities and countries in which they live."</p>
<p>Just how much could hunger be reduced if women had equal access to agricultural resources? The report estimates that hunger could be reduced for an extra one hundred to one hundred fifty million people.</p>

<p>JUNE SIMMS: Welcome to THIS IS AMERICA in VOA Special English. I'm June Simms.</p>
<p>BOB DOUGHTY: And I'm Bob Doughty. Birth control is usually a private issue. This week on our program, we look at some of the reasons why this issue has been getting a lot of public attention recently in the United States.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>JUNE SIMMS: Peter, Chris, Lisa and Patty are college students here in Washington. They all attend George Washington University. They also have something else in common. They are all Catholic. They share the belief of the Roman Catholic Church that using contraception to prevent new human life is morally wrong.</p>
<p>Peter -- we'll just use first names -- says he knows that belief puts him and his friends in a minority in the popular culture around them.</p>
<p>PETER: "I believe that our generation -- my generation -- has been brought up with a different form of family planning than our parents, than our grandparents. My mother's one of nine. I'm an only child. We were taught, 'Do you want to have that many kids?' Sort of pushed: 'Do you want to plan how many kids you have?'"</p>
<p>BOB DOUGHTY: Chris agrees. He remembers what he was taught at the public high school he attended in New Hampshire.</p>
<p>CHRIS: "The way they taught it was, the only way that you can definitely not get pregnant and not get an STD is to be abstinent. They also told you how to have -- quote, unquote -- safe sex."</p>
<p>In other words, Chris feels he got conflicting messages. Students were taught that they could avoid pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases by avoiding sex. But at the same time they were also taught how to have so-called safe sex, like using condoms.</p>
<p>JUNE SIMMS: Different states have different requirements for offering sex education or "family life education" in public schools. Lisa grew up in a relatively conservative city in Colorado. Her teachers were not required to discuss contraception. Instead, she says they talked a lot about the importance of not having sex until marriage.</p>
<p>But Lisa says in popular culture, girls are often told they should go on birth control pills for reasons other than preventing pregnancy.</p>
<p>LISA: "'Birth control's the answer to everything.' You have a pimple? You get birth control. You have a bad cramp? You get birth control. It's the answer to a lot of things for girls. You're just annoyed and someone's like, 'Oh, just go get birth control.'"</p>
<p>Patty still remembers being shown images of untreated diseases when she was learning in school about the risks of having sex.</p>
<p>PATTY: "I remember we had to watch a lot of videos in my health class and -- ugh!"</p>
<p>BOB DOUGHTY: But teenagers appear to be paying attention to those warnings about STDs and lessons about sex education.</p>
<p>For most of the past twenty years, teen birthrates in the United States have fallen. The latest government report shows that the birthrate for teens age fifteen to nineteen fell to a record low in twenty-ten. There were thirty-four births for every one thousand teenagers. That was the lowest rate in almost seventy years of keeping records.</p>
<p>The Guttmacher Institute is a research and policy organization that works on sexual and reproductive health issues. It says nearly half of all pregnancies in the United States are unplanned. And of these, about four in ten are ended by abortion.</p>
<p>Abortion rates began falling in the nineteen eighties. However, the rate of decrease slowed to a halt between two thousand five and two thousand eight, the most recent years available.</p>
<p>The Guttmacher Institute says nearly fifty million abortions took place between nineteen seventy-three and two thousand eight. Nineteen seventy-three was the year the Supreme Court decided that women have a legal right to abortion.</p>
<p>Three years earlier, Congress and President Richard Nixon agreed that the government should help pay for family planning services for the poor. But that does not include abortion. Under current law, federal funds can only be used to pay for abortions in cases of rape, incest or to save the mother's life.</p>
<p>JUNE SIMMS: People may agree that unwanted pregnancies should be avoided in the first place. But that does not mean they agree on the issue of contraception.</p>
<p>In recent months, birth control has become a topic of heated debate. It started last December with a government decision about a birth control product called Plan B. Plan B, often called the "morning after pill," is meant as an emergency form of contraception. It can prevent pregnancy if taken up to seventy-two hours after unprotected sex.</p>
<p>Woman age seventeen and older can buy it at a drug store without a prescription. Federal officials wanted to approve a request by Plan B's maker to also let girls under seventeen buy it without a prescription.</p>
<p>BOB DOUGHTY: But President Obama's secretary of health and human services, Kathleen Sebilius, intervened to block that approval. She said there was not enough research on the use of Plan B in younger girls.</p>
<p>Critics said the Obama administration was just trying to avoid what could have been a politically hot issue in the presidential campaign. They said making Plan B available without a doctor's order could help more teenagers prevent pregnancy. But supporters of the decision say younger teens who are worried about being pregnant should have to talk to an adult for guidance.</p>
<p>JUNE SIMMS: Another cause of the birth control debate came in January. The administration announced that all health plans provided by employers will have to pay the full cost of women's preventive services, including birth control.</p>
<p>Women would not have to pay any extra, like the co-payment that Elia was making for birth control pills. Elia is twenty-three. She says she wants to start a family but wants to finish her education first. But she says her daily pills were costing too much.</p>
<p>ELIA: "It's a burden for somebody my age to have to think about how to afford even just the co-pay of twenty dollars a month for birth control. I have a good job, but twenty dollars a month every single month ends up being quite a bit over the course of a year."</p>
<p>So Elia says she has stopped using the Pill and started using condoms. The cost is lower, but experts say the risk of an accidental pregnancy is higher.</p>
<p>David Downing is a women's health doctor at Washington Hospital Center. He says Elia's story is common.</p>
<p>DAVID DOWNING: "Some patients do make decisions based on their pocketbooks. And sometimes that decision doesn't necessarily go along with what the best medical recommendation is."</p>
<p>Dr. Downing says not having to pay for contraception would help about eighty percent of his patients. He says women would have more control over their reproductive health and there would be fewer unplanned pregnancies.</p>
<p>BOB DOUGHTY: But opponents say the government does not have a right to tell employers what health services they must provide to their workers. Most Americans buy health insurance through their jobs and share the cost with their employers.</p>
<p>(SOUND<strong>)</strong></p>
<p>In March, opponents held protests in a number of cities. A fourteen-year-old girl named Veronica took part in a demonstration outside the Health and Human Services building in Washington.</p>
<p><span class="margin-bottom-small display-block container field-note">&lt;!--IMAGE-LEFT--&gt;</span></p>
<p>VERONICA: "It's a horrible thing that our government is forcing upon us."</p>
<p>The debate also has a religious connection. This involves employers such as schools or hospitals that are part of religious organizations that do not believe in birth control. They say requiring them to provide health coverage for contraception would violate their constitutional right to religious freedom.</p>
<p>A Catholic mother named Heather brought her five children to last month's rally in Washington. She explained how she sees the issue.</p>
<p>HEATHER: "What if one of my children grows up and owns a company, and they have employees that are demanding that my children pay for their abortions or their contraception? That's completely unjust and against our Constitution."</p>
<p>The policy would not require insurance companies to pay for abortions. Also, the administration has proposed what it considers a compromise with religious groups so that some would not have to follow the new policy.</p>
<p>The policy is supposed to take effect this August as part of the Obama administration's major health law, known as the Affordable Care Act. Before then, however, the Supreme Court is expected to rule on the future of the law itself.</p>
<p>Some people, especially critics, call it Obamacare. Congress passed it in twenty-ten. Last month the Supreme Court heard arguments about major parts of the law. These include a requirement for most Americans to have health insurance by twenty-fourteen or pay a fine.</p>
<p>Opponents say the Constitution does not give the government the right to require individuals to buy something. Supporters say the goal is to keep down costs for everyone and prevent people who do not have insurance from waiting until they get sick to buy it. The law bars insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court is expected to rule by the end of June.</p>
<p>JUNE SIMMS: Some Democrats accuse Republicans of leading a "war on women" by opposing measures like the new contraception policy. Mitt Romney, the leading Republican presidential candidate, told one young woman if she wanted "free stuff" from the government, she should vote for President Obama.</p>
<p>The majority of American voters are women. Public opinion surveys show Mr. Obama with a large lead among women in the most competitive "battleground" states. But how important an issue is birth control in the race toward Election Day in November?</p>
<p>In a national Gallup Poll in late March, fifty-five percent of women voters rated government policies on birth control as important. Only thirty-five percent of men agreed.</p>
<p>Women are more likely than men to identify themselves as Democrats. And Democrats are much more likely than independents or Republicans to say birth control policies will be important to their vote. But even Democrats rated those policies last on a list of important issues. Among all voters, the top issues were health care, unemployment, the federal budget deficit, international issues and gasoline prices.</p>

<p>This is the VOA Special English Technology Report.</p>
<p>Last week, we told you about efforts by Microsoft Corporation to stop Zeus, one of the most harmful cybercrime operations active today. Zeus hackers use a network of infected computers, known as botnets, to steal personal information from computer users.</p>
<p>On March twenty-third, officials seized computer servers in two states, Pennsylvania and Illinois. The servers were said to be operating some of the worst known Zeus botnets.</p>
<p>Richard Boscovich is with the Digital Crimes Unit at Microsoft. He says the operators of the servers did not know they were linked to cybercrime.</p>
<p>RICHARD BOSCOVICH: “The hosting providers in and of themselves are not necessarily in cahoots with the criminals, so to speak. In the room that we walked into there were over ten thousand computers. So their business is simply to host customers.”</p>
<p>Zeus botnets are positioned all over the world. Mr. Boscovich says they act as command and control centers for the infected computers.</p>
<p>RICHARD BOSCOVICH: “It’s not just one botnet but probably hundreds of different botnets that come from this particular code base.”</p>
<p>And, he says, the Zeus botnets are not easy to identify.</p>
<p>RICHARD BOSCOVICH: “These command and control centers are constantly moving. So it takes a lot of effort to be able to identify where they were, or where they are and where they are going to be.”</p>
<p>Microsoft says it is studying information gathered from the servers that were seized last month. It hopes to gather more evidence against the unidentified Zeus operators. It also hopes to identify and notify the more than thirteen million computer users that have been infected with the Zeus malware.</p>
<p>Mr. Boscovich says there are many things that users can and should do to protect themselves from harmful software programs. At the very least, he says, they should be using legitimate software that has been purchased from creditable providers. And he says every computer must have current anti-virus software.</p>
<p>Most of all, Mr. Boscovich says, computer users must be careful about e-mails.</p>
<p>RICHARD BOSCOVICH: “The bad guys are extremely adept at sending emails that appear to be from friends, from family members or from banks or companies, in fact.”</p>
<p>Microsoft is not alone in efforts to fight cybercrime. Security experts from CrowdStrike, Dell SecureWorks and other companies took down a large botnet known as Kelihos last month. As quickly as Kelihos was stopped, researchers say cybercriminals began working to build another botnet.</p>
<p>Also last month, the European Union announced steps to fight the growing problem of cybercrime. They include plans to establish a new cybercrimes center, to be based in The Hague. The center will deal with issues like misuse of credit card information, identity theft and the sexual abuse of children online.</p>

<p>SHEP O’NEAL: People in America -- a program in Special English by the Voice of America. Every week at this time, we tell the story of a man or a woman who played an important part in the history of the United States. Today, Larry West and Warren Scheer begin the story of Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce Indians. He is remembered as a hero of all American Indian people.</p>
<p>LARRY WEST: Chief Joseph loved peace.  But he was forced to lead his people in war.  He loved freedom and his land.  But he lost both.  Chief Joseph’s story begins with his people and his land.</p>
<p>WARREN SCHEER: An old man looks out at a green valley. Tall dark mountains stand above it. Snow covers the mountain tops. In the clear water of a lake dance the dark shapes of the mountains.</p>
<p>The old man's name is Tuekakas. White men call him old Joseph. The Wallowa Valley is the old man's home -- and the home of the Nez Perce people -- for as long as anyone can remember. It lies in the northwestern part of the United States. Today, the land is part of the states of Idaho, Oregon and Washington.</p>
<p>No one knows exactly when the Nez Perce first came to the valley. From earliest times, the people hunted and raised cattle there. They kept horses, the kind called Appaloosas.</p>
<p>LARRY WEST: The Nez Perce did not own the land. They had not bought it from anyone else. They possessed no documents of ownership. But they believed the land was theirs, simply because that was where they lived.</p>
<p>For almost seventy years, the Nez Perce showed friendship to the white farmers, churchmen and explorers who came to their land.</p>
<p>Old Joseph, the chief, had been a friend to the white men. But in eighteen seventy-one, as he looked out across the valley, he could see a time of trouble coming. White people had discovered gold in mountains on Nez Perce land. More and more white farmers were asking the United States government to open the land for development.</p>
<p>To do that, the Indians had to be moved. The government usually offered the Indians money or gifts to leave the area. Different deals were made with different Indian groups.</p>
<p>WARREN SCHEER: Several years before, the white governor of the territory met with old Joseph. He asked the chief to sign a treaty. The governor said he wanted the land divided so the Indians and white men could live separately. "If the two groups are to live in peace," the governor said, "it is necessary for the Indians to have a country set apart for them. And in that country they must stay."</p>
<p>Old Joseph was furious. "Take away your paper," he said. "I will not touch it with my hand."</p>
<p>Other Nez Perce chiefs, however -- beyond the valley -- signed treaties to give up their lands. Those chiefs and their people became Christians. They cut their hair short. They forgot the ways of their tribe.</p>
<p>Old Joseph's people did not forget. They wore their hair long. And they loved the land.</p>
<p>LARRY WEST: Old Joseph had been chief for many years. Now he was dying. He called for his first son. The son, like the father, was named Joseph.</p>
<p>Old Joseph spoke. His voice was the voice of a dying man. But his words were the words of a strong, proud spirit: "My son," the old man said, "when I am gone you will be chief of these people. They look to you to guide them. Always remember that your father never gave up his land.</p>
<p>WARREN SCHEER: Young Joseph was thirty-one years old when his father died. His people called him Heinmot Tooyalaket. Those were the words the Nez Perce used to describe the noise that lightning makes in the mountains.</p>
<p>The young man had a wide face. His hair was tied on both sides of his head and hung down on his chest like long, heavy ropes. He wore chains of seashells around his neck. Small pieces of colored glass shone brightly on his clothing. Already, the Nez Perce knew him for his good judgment, his kindness, and his ability with words. And now they would know him as their leader -- Chief Joseph.</p>
<p>Chief Joseph remembered his dying father's words. He said: "This land has always belonged to my people. We will defend this land as long as Indian blood warms the hearts of our men."</p>
<p>LARRY WEST: In eighteen seventy-three, Chief Joseph sent a message to the President of the United States, Ulysses Grant. He asked that no more white persons be permitted to live in the Wallowa Valley. President Grant agreed. But two years later, under pressure from farmers and gold-hunters, the president broke his promise. More white people came. Some stole cattle and horses. Some insulted the Indians.</p>
<p>Always, Chief Joseph kept the peace.</p>
<p>In May, eighteen seventy-seven, the government told General Oliver Howard to meet with the Nez Perce chiefs. He was ordered to tell the Indians that they must leave their land. The government had a place in Idaho for all Nez Perce people. It was called the Lapwai Reservation.</p>
<p>General Howard did not like his orders. To his friends he said it was a great mistake to take the valley from Joseph. But the general had spent many years in the army. He obeyed his orders.</p>
<p>To the Nez Perce chiefs he said: "I stand here for the president. My orders are clear and must be obeyed. You have thirty days to leave the valley. If you delay even one day," General Howard said, "the soldiers will force you to the reservation. And all your cattle and horses will fall into the hands of the white men."</p>
<p>WARREN SCHEER: The chiefs had a difficult choice. They could leave. Or they could fight. Joseph and the other chiefs had only ninety warriors. They knew they could not defend the valley with such a small fighting force. Chief Joseph said: "I have carried a heavy load on my back ever since I was a boy. I learned then that we were but few, while the white men were many, and that we could not defeat them.</p>
<p>LARRY WEST: Some of the Nez Perce chiefs wanted to stay and fight. They were willing to try, even if there was little chance of winning. But Joseph said, "To protect my people from war, I will give up my country. I will give up everything."</p>
<p>So the Nez Perce prepared to leave the Wallowa Valley. To get to the reservation in time, they had to leave behind many of the things they owned. They took some cattle and horses, and what food and possessions they could carry.</p>
<p>Chief Joseph had promised them peace. But peace would not follow them.</p>
<p>That will be our story next week.</p>

<p>Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.<br /><br />Some expressions describe people who are important, or who at least think they are. One such expression is <strong>bigwig</strong>.<br /><br />In the seventeenth century, important men in Europe began to wear false hair, called wigs. As years passed, wigs began to get bigger. The size of a man's wig depended on how important he was. The more important he was -- or thought he was -- the bigger the wig he wore. Some wigs were so large they covered a man's shoulders or back.<br /><br />Today, the expression <strong>bigwig</strong> is used to make fun of a person who feels important. People never tell someone he is a bigwig. They only use the expression behind his back.<br /><br /><strong>Big wheel</strong> is another way to describe an important person. A big wheel may be the head of a company, a political leader, a famous movie star. They are big wheels because they are powerful. What they do affects many people. Big wheels give the orders. Other people carry them out.  As in many machines, a big wheel makes the little wheels turn.<br /><br />Big wheel [became] a popular expression after World War Two. It probably comes from an expression used for many years by people who fix parts of cars and trucks. They said a person <strong>rolled a big wheel</strong> if he was important and had influence.<br /><br />The top of something is the highest part. So it is not surprising that top is part of another expression that describes an important person. The expression is <strong>top banana</strong>.  A top banana is the leading person in a comedy show. The funniest comedian is called the top banana. The next is second banana. And so on.<br /><br />Why a banana? A comedy act in earlier days often included a part where one of the comedians would hit the others over the head with a soft object. The object was shaped like the yellow fruit: the banana.<br /><br />Top banana still is used mainly in show business. Yet the expression can also be used to describe the top person in any area.<br /><br />A <strong>kingpin</strong> is another word for an important person. The expression comes from the game of bowling. The kingpin is the number one pin. If hit correctly with the bowling ball, the kingpin will make all the other nine pins fall. And that is the object of the game.<br /><br />So, the most important person in a project or business is the kingpin.  If the kingpin is removed, the business or project is likely to fail.<br /><br />Kingpin is often used to describe an important criminal, or the leader of a criminal gang. A newspaper may report, for example, that police have arrested the suspected kingpin of a car-stealing operation.<br /><br />(MUSIC)<br /><br />This VOA Special English program, WORDS AND THEIR STORIES, was written by Marilyn Christiano.  I'm Warren Scheer.<br /><br /></p>

<p>This is IN THE NEWS in VOA Special English.</p>
<p>A ceasefire proposed by the United Nations is supposed to take effect in Syria in the coming days. But Syrian government forces continued to attack opposition targets across the country on Friday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says more than twenty people were killed -- most of them civilians. Opposition activities say tens of thousands of Syrians took part in anti-government protests.</p>
<p>The Syrian government says it has begun withdrawing its troops from major cities. But on Thursday, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon warned that Syria's conflict was growing. He said attacks by government forces on civilian areas showed no signs of slowing. He urged President Bashar al-Assad "to show leadership and vision" and keep his promise to end the violence by this Tuesday. The opposition is supposed to do the same within forty-eight hours after that.</p>
<p>Hilal Khashan teaches political science at the American University of Beirut. He thinks President Assad is unlikely to follow the peace plan because that would give the opposition new strength.</p>
<p>HILAL KHASHAN: "This means that Syrians will feel free to demonstrate against the regime with impunity. This is unthinkable. Assad will never allow such developments to occur. Therefore, he will find reasons to defeat the mission of Kofi Annan."</p>
<p>Professor Khashan says he think Mr. Annan's diplomatic efforts represent the "last chance" that Mr. Assad will receive from the international community. The Syrian leader agreed to the U.N. peace plan on March twenty-fifth.</p>
<p><span class="margin-bottom-small display-block container field-note"> &lt;!--IMAGE-RIGHT--&gt;</span>Growing numbers of Syrians fleeing the violence have poured into neighboring Turkey. Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu called the U.N. secretary-general on Friday to express concern about the growing number of refugees.</p>
<p>The United Nations says more than nine thousand people have been killed since the uprising against Mr. Assad began thirteen months ago.</p>
<p>Anti-government opposition groups held protests in a number of towns and cities after Friday prayers.</p>
<p>(SOUND)</p>
<p>Opposition videos showed hundreds of protesters demonstrating on Friday in the northern city of Aleppo. Videos also showed large protests in several other areas and in Damascus.</p>
<p>Witnesses reported heavy government shelling in the city of Homs Friday. Parts of Homs have come under government shelling for weeks.</p>
<p>Al Arabiya television reported that government troops stormed Douma outside Damascus and made large numbers of arrests. Government forces have temporarily retaken parts of Douma several times, only to lose control later.</p>
<p>Former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan proposed the peace plan. He said Thursday that there was little progress on ending the conflict. Russia and China, both allies of the Syrian government, have increased pressure on Syrian officials to follow the plan.</p>
<p>Syria blames much of the violence on what it calls "terrorists" supported by "Arab and Western countries." It says terrorist acts increased after the government reached an agreement on Mr. Annan's peace plan.</p>

<p>JUNE SIMMS: Welcome to AMERICAN MOSAIC in VOA Special English.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>I’m June Simms. This week on our program, we have music from Drake ...</p>
<p>We also look at the history of the world's best-known American word ...</p>
<p>But first we tell you about some terms in American English that not even all Americans would know.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p><strong>Dictionary of American Regional English </strong></p>
<p>JUNE SIMMS: In your country, are there terms that only people from your area can understand? Local language may be meaningless to outsiders without a special dictionary, like the Dictionary of American Regional English. As Barbara Klein reports, the fifth and final volume of the dictionary known as DARE has just been published.</p>
<p>BARBARA KLEIN: Joan Houston Hall is the chief editor of the Dictionary of American Regional English. She says DARE includes words, phrases, pronunciations and even grammar and syntax that differ from one part of the country to another.</p>
<p>JOAN HOUSTON HALL: "That strip of grass between the sidewalk and the street can be the parking strip, the parking, the parkway, the berm, the terrace, the tree lawn, the tree belt, the tree box, and the verge and the swale and other things, too. It’s amazing to see the tremendous variety of terms used for the same thing."</p>
<p>BARBARA KLEIN: In some parts of the country, a carbonated soft drink is known as a soda; in others, people call it pop. Some Americans cook with what they call a frying pan; others call it a skillet. And a party where everyone brings food is either a potluck or a pitch-in.</p>
<p><span class="margin-bottom-small display-block container field-note">&lt;!--IMAGE-RIGHT--&gt;</span>Work on the Dictionary of American Regional English began in nineteen sixty-five under Frederic Cassidy. He was an English professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He and a team of eighty researchers traveled across the United States to document words used by Americans to describe their daily lives.</p>
<p>The first volume, A to C, was released in nineteen eighty-five. The final volume starts with slab, a term for a concrete road, and ends with zydeco, a kind of music popular in Louisiana.</p>
<p>Joan Houston Hall showed the final volume at a meeting of the American Dialect Society in January. Linguist Ben Zimmer writes about language for the Boston Globe and recalls the excitement.</p>
<p>BEN ZIMMER: "People just wanted to touch it like it was the holy relic or something."</p>
<p>BARBARA KLEIN: The Dictionary of American Regional English contains almost sixty thousand words and terms that offer a linguistic tour of America. One word we liked is honeyfuggle. It means to cheat or trick. The earliest uses were found in the eighteen hundreds in the South.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p><strong>The Story of OK</strong></p>
<p>JUNE SIMMS: Next we turn to the story of an American word that began in Boston, Massachusetts, and spread around the world. "OK" started as a joke in eighteen thirty-nine -- and, no, we're not honeyfuggling you.</p>
<p>Our listener question this week comes from Stirlitz, an English teacher in Cuba. She wants to know the true origin of OK. She says, "I have five different versions but I don't know which one to pick."</p>
<p>Well, a couple of years ago, VOA's Avi Arditti and Rosanne Skirble talked with Allan Metcalf. He wrote the book "OK: The Improbable Story of America's Greatest Word." And, he says, not just the greatest word.</p>
<p>ALLAN METCALF: "America's most important word. The most successful American export to the rest of the world. And also an embodiment of the American philosophy, the American way of thinking."</p>
<p>AA: "All this, packed into two letters."</p>
<p>ALLAN METCALF: "Yes, that's the beauty of it and that's the economy of it. One of the two aspects of the American view of the world is pragmatism, getting things done. Even if they're not perfect, they're OK. And the nice thing about OK is it doesn't imply that everything is perfect or beautiful or wonderful. In fact, it's a neutral affirmation. When you say 'That's OK' or someone asks you 'How are you?' and you say 'I'm OK,' it doesn't mean that you're in perfect health. But it also doesn't mean that you're sick.</p>
<p>RS: "O-K are just two letters of the alphabet. Do they stand for something?"</p>
<p>ALLAN METCALF: "Well, they do, as a matter of fact. One of the curious things about OK that makes it require a whole book to tell its story is that it began as a joke. It was on March twenty-third, eighteen thirty-nine, in a Boston newspaper, that the newspaper first used 'o.k.' and explained those as an abbreviation for 'all correct.' And, of course, the joke was that 'o' is not the beginning of 'all' and 'k' is not the beginning of 'correct.' So this thing supposedly all correct was not all correct."</p>
<p>JUNE SIMMS: At that time, Boston newspapers were publishing all sorts of abbreviations that were meant to be funny. Most of these disappeared.</p>
<p>ALLAN METCALF: "But it turns out that in the next year, eighteen forty, in the American presidential election of eighteen forty, a man named Martin Van Buren was running for re-election. He happened to come from Kinderhook, New York, and so somebody thought of calling him 'Old Kinderhook' and then thought of founding clubs supporting him throughout the country, called OK Clubs. OK, Old Kinderhook, is OK, all correct or all right. And that suddenly gave continued life and prominence to OK."</p>
<p>JUNE SIMMS: And then a third thing happened.</p>
<p>ALLAN METCALF: "During that presidential election year, Martin Van Buren's predecessor as president had been Andrew Jackson, and so there was an attack on Andrew Jackson by an opponent of Van Buren. The attack said that Jackson couldn't spell, so that Jackson would look at a document and if he approved of it, he would write 'OK' on it, meaning it was all correct. Now it turns out that that was a complete hoax."</p>
<p>JUNE SIMMS: Andrew Jackson never wrote OK on a document, Allan Metcalf says. But as a result of that story, within about twenty years people really began marking OK on documents. People have been doing that ever since. But Allan Metcalf says the idea that OK began as a joke kept people trying to guess where it really came from.</p>
<p>ALLAN METCALF: "The OK-as-Andrew-Jackson's hoax was the first misleading statement of its origins. And then around the eighteen eighties a professor decided that the true origin was from the Choctaw Indian language, where they had an expression like OK which means 'it is so,' and for various reasons that was proposed as the true explanation for OK. They spelled it 'o-k-e-h,' and the only American president ever to have a PhD, Woodrow Wilson, thought that was the correct explanation, so he would mark o-k-e-h on documents."</p>
<p>RS: "How does OK in our vocabulary represent who we are as Americans?"</p>
<p>ALLAN METCALF: "One way that it represents who we are is that it represents the pragmatic sense of getting it done. Maybe not getting it done perfectly, but it's OK. But the other way began with a book published in 1967 by a guy named Thomas Harris. The book is called 'I'm OK -- You're OK.' And the book happens to be about a kind of psychology known as transactional analysis.</p>
<p>"'I'm OK' -- that means I can do what I want. 'You're OK' -- you can do what you want. Maybe we aren't doing the same thing, but that's OK."</p>
<p>JUNE SIMMS: Allan Metcalf is an English professor at MacMurray College in Jacksonville, Illinois, and longtime executive secretary of the American Dialect Society.</p>
<p>He's been trying to gather support to celebrate a national OK Day each year on March twenty-third -- the day it first appeared in the newspaper.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p><strong>Drake</strong></p>
<p><span class="margin-bottom-small display-block container field-note">&lt;!--IMAGE-LEFT--&gt;</span>JUNE SIMMS: Twenty-five year old Aubrey Drake Graham is best known by his stage name – Drake or Dizzy Drake. His second record album, “Take Care,” was released last November. Christopher Cruise has more.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>CHRISTOPHER CRUISE: “Headlines” was the first single from Drake’s latest album “Take Care.” The song quickly made its way to the number one position on Billboard magazine’s Rap Songs chart. It rose to number eighteen on the Canadian Hot 100 chart. Shortly after the album was released, it appeared at number nine on Billboard’s Hot 100 list.</p>
<p>Aubrey Drake Graham was born in the Canadian city of Toronto on October twenty-eighth, nineteen eighty six. His parents ended their marriage when he was five years old. He lived with his mother in Toronto’s wealthy Forest Hill neighborhood and spent summers with his father.</p>
<p>Aubrey Drake Graham attended high school at the Forest Hill Collegiate Institute, where he began acting. He left high school before his studies were completed. But he went on to seek positions in acting. In two thousand one, he got the part of Jimmy Brooks in the television show “Degrassi: The Next Generation.” His work on the show ended in two thousand nine, when Jimmy finally graduated from the school.</p>
<p>In two thousand eight, Drake heard from recording artist Dwayne Carter, better known as Lil Wayne. The hip-hop star had heard about Drake’s music and flew him out to Houston for some performances.  The two men worked together on many projects. In two thousand nine, Lil Wayne signed Drake to his recording label, “Young Money.”</p>
<p><span class="margin-bottom-small display-block container field-note">&lt;!--IMAGE-RIGHT--&gt;</span></p>
<p>Under the deal, Drake received two million dollars before recording his first album. He also got total publishing rights for all of his work. “Young Money” only got twenty-five percent on money earned from his music sales.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>Within months of the deal, Drake released “So Far Gone,” which included the hit single “Best I Ever Had.” The single quickly claimed the number one position on Billboard’s R&amp;B and Hip-Hop Song charts. It also earned two Grammy Award nominations, three Soul Train Award nominations, five BET Hip-Hop Award nominations and an MTV Video music Award nomination.</p>
<p>Drake has released two albums since signing his record deal. We leave you with “Look What You’ve Done,” a song from his album, “Take Care.”</p>

<p>This is the VOA Special English Economics Report.</p>
<p>The best example of something is often called the "gold standard." It sets the standard against which other things are measured. In economics, the term describes how major trading nations once used gold to set currency values and exchange rates. Many nations continued to use the gold standard<strong> </strong>until the last century.</p>
<p>In the United   States, people could exchange paper money for gold from the eighteen seventies until nineteen thirty-three. Then-President Richard Nixon finally disconnected the dollar from the value of gold in nineteen seventy-one. From time to time, some politicians call for a return to the gold standard.</p>
<p>But in nineteen seventy eight, the International Monetary Fund ended an official gold price. The IMF also ended the required use of gold in transactions with its member countries.</p>
<p>Since that time, gold prices have grown. But the growth was uneven. Prices -- uncorrected for inflation – continue near record highs. Gold is trading above one thousand six hundred dollars an ounce.  An ounce is about twenty-eight grams.</p>
<p>But people keep buying.  Some people are "gold bugs." These are investors who say people should buy gold to protect against inflation.</p>
<p>People have valued gold for thousands of years. The soft, dense metal polishes to a bright yellow shine and resists most chemical reactions. It makes a good material for money, political power -- and, more recently, electrical power. If you own a device like a mobile phone or a computer, you might own a little gold in the wiring.</p>
<p>The gold standard was the subject of one of the best-known speeches in American political history. It took place at the eighteen ninety-six Democratic National Convention in Chicago.</p>
<p>William Jennings Bryan wanted the country to use both gold and silver as money. The idea was to devalue the dollar and make it easier for farmers to pay their debts. Here is Bryan reading his speech much later, in nineteen twenty-one.</p>
<p>WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN: "You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns. You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold."</p>
<p>The speech made William Jennings Bryan famous. He was a presidential candidate three times. But he never won.</p>

<p>STEVE EMBER: Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION – American history in VOA Special English. I'm Steve Ember.</p>
<p>This week in our series, we look at America after the events of September eleventh, two thousand one.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>DAN RATHER: "A stunning and cowardly strike on the United States. Terrorists send mighty skyscrapers crumbling to the ground. Many innocent people are dead. The president vows the killers will pay for this attack on America."</p>
<p>The United States changed as a result of the September eleventh terrorist attacks. CBS newsman Dan Rather expressed what many Americans were feeling.</p>
<p>DAN RATHER: "You will remember this day as long as you live. A series of coordinated terror strikes today at this country, its people, our freedom. Strikes that came without warning."</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>On the morning of that sunny September day that came to be known as 9/11, the nation came under attack from al-Qaida, an extremist group led by Osama bin Laden. Its targets were world-famous buildings representing America's economic and military power.</p>
<p>Al-Qaida operatives hijacked four American passenger airplanes. The hijackers were from Middle Eastern countries. Each group included a pilot trained to fly two kinds of Boeing airliners, the 757 and the 767.</p>
<p>At eight forty-six on that morning, one group of hijackers flew a Boeing 767 into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City. Seventeen minutes later, another group flew a second 767 into the Trade Center's South Tower.</p>
<p>The planes exploded in fireballs that sent clouds of smoke into the air. The intense heat of the burning jet fuel from the planes caused structural failures that brought down both buildings.</p>
<p>About an hour after the first plane hit the World Trade Center, another group of al-Qaida operatives flew a 757 airliner into the Pentagon, the headquarters of the Defense Department, in Arlington, Virginia. The plane exploded against a wall of the huge building where more than twenty thousand people worked.</p>
<p>A fourth group had taken control of another 757. But some of the passengers on that flight, United 93, had heard about the terrorist attacks through phone calls to their families. Several passengers and crew members attempted to retake control of the plane. It crashed near the town of Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Investigators later said the hijackers probably planned to attack the Capitol, a major government building in Washington, D.C., where Congress meets.</p>
<p>There was also concern that the White House could have been a target.</p>
<p>The 9/11 attacks saw the worst loss of lives on American soil since Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in nineteen forty-one. That attack caused the United States to enter World War Two.</p>
<p><span class="field-note container display-block margin-bottom-small">&lt;!--IMAGE-LEFT--&gt;</span>GEORGE W. BUSH: "The pictures of airplanes flying into buildings, fires burning, huge structures collapsing have filled us with disbelief, terrible sadness, and a quiet, unyielding anger."</p>
<p>As expressed by President George W. Bush on 9/11, the attacks left Americans in a state of shock and disbelief. But that was soon replaced by anger and a resolve that this would not be allowed to happen again.</p>
<p>GEORGE W. BUSH: "These acts of mass murder were intended to frighten our nation into chaos and retreat. But they have failed. Our country is strong. A great people has been moved to defend a great nation.</p>
<p>"Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings, but they can not touch the foundation of America. These acts shatter steel, but they can not dent the steel of American resolve."</p>
<p>At Ground Zero, the site of the World Trade Center destruction, rescue efforts continued into the night. New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was asked if Arab-American or Muslim groups in New York might be targeted due to the nature of the attacks.</p>
<p>RUDY GIULIANI: "Just the opposite. They will receive extra protection. Nobody should engage in group blame. The particular individuals responsible, the groups responsible, that's up to law enforcement, and it's up to the United States government to figure out. And citizens of New York should -- even if they have anger, which is understandable, and very, very strong emotions about this -- it isn't their place to get involved in this. Then, they're just participating in the kind of activity we've just witnessed, and New Yorkers are not like that."</p>
<p>And Giuliani spoke of the strength of the spirit of the people of his city.</p>
<p><span class="field-note container display-block margin-bottom-small">&lt;!--IMAGE-LEFT--&gt;</span></p>
<p>RUDY GIULIANI: "People tonight should say a prayer for the people that we've lost, and be grateful that we're all here. Tomorrow, New York is going to be here, and we're going to rebuild, and we're going to be stronger than we were before."</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>On September twentieth, President Bush went before a joint session of Congress to declare a war on terror.</p>
<p>GEORGE W. BUSH: "Our war on terror begins with al-Qaida, but it does not end there. It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated. [Applause]"</p>
<p>President Bush explained that the war on terror would be different from other wars.</p>
<p>GEORGE W. BUSH: "Our response involves far more than instant retaliation and isolated strikes. Americans should not expect one battle, but a lengthy campaign, unlike any other we have ever seen. It may include dramatic strikes, visible on TV, and covert operations, secret even in success. We will starve terrorists of funding, turn them one against another, drive them from place to place, until there is no refuge or no rest. And we will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism.</p>
<p>"Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists. [Applause] From this day forward, any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime."</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>President Bush demanded that the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan stop sheltering Osama bin Laden and surrender him. The president also called on the Taliban to close terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The Taliban refused. They demanded evidence that Osama bin Laden had been involved in the attacks of 9/11. They said that if such evidence was provided, he would be tried in an Islamic court. The United States refused to provide evidence.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>On October seventh, the United States and Britain launched air strikes against Taliban targets. What became known as the War on Terror had begun.</p>
<p>Tribal groups from the opposition Northern Alliance led a ground attack. But suicide bombers had killed their leader, Ahmad Shah Masood, on September ninth, two days before the 9/11 attacks.</p>
<p>By November, Taliban control began to collapse in several provinces. Taliban forces fled Kabul, the capital. But the ouster of the Taliban government did not mean the end of the war on terror.</p>
<p>Some of President Bush's advisers had long supported an invasion of Iraq. As early as October two thousand one, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld suggested that military action against Iraq was possible. Government officials accused Iraq of having links to terrorist groups like al-Qaida. They noted that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had used chemical weapons. And they said he was seeking to develop biological and nuclear weapons as well.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>In October, two thousand one, Congress passed the U.S.A. Patriot Act. This law provided the government with more power to gather information about suspected terrorists in the United States. Critics said the law invaded constitutional rights to privacy. Civil liberties groups said the Patriot Act gave law enforcement and other agencies too much power.</p>
<p>In January two thousand two, President Bush gave his State of the Union report to Congress. He accused some nations of supporting terrorist organizations. He said the United States would not wait to be attacked by such groups. Instead, it would strike first at the countries that sheltered them. The president identified three nations – North Korea, Iran and Iraq -- as supporters of terror.</p>
<p>GEORGE W. BUSH: "States like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred."</p>

<p>In two thousand two, the United States opened a detention center at its naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Some of the fighters arrested in Afghanistan were sent there. They were not considered prisoners of war. Instead, the detainees were treated as "unlawful enemy combatants." As such, the Bush administration said they did not have the same rights as war prisoners under international treaties.</p>
<p>In the United States, the government also detained some foreign citizens, mostly for violating immigration laws. No terrorism charges were brought against these detainees. Human rights activists and some legal experts protested the detentions.</p>
<p>After 9/11, government agencies were criticized for failing to prevent the terrorist attacks. Critics said the agencies should have been working together to gather intelligence. Government officials said part of the issue involved legal restrictions on the gathering and sharing of intelligence.</p>

<p>The attacks of 9/11 had a major effect on the commercial aviation industry. The skies over Washington and other cities became strangely silent.</p>
<p>Washington's busy Ronald Reagan National Airport was closed for several weeks after the attacks. When it reopened, new security measures for inspecting passengers and their belongings were put in place. Similar measures were in force at other airports across the nation.</p>
<p>Fears over safety among the traveling public led to a drop in the number of airline passengers. As a result, the airlines began to use smaller planes. Costly changes were necessary to "harden" the cockpit, to prevent more terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>The increased security led to delays and other problems. But slowly, Americans began to fly again in greater numbers. But airlines had to work hard to win back the trust of the traveling public.</p>
<p>(SOUND: United Airlines commercial)</p>
<p>One carrier, United, ran a low-key television advertising campaign, in which actor Robert Redford, at the end of each ad gently suggested</p>
<p>ROBERT REDFORD: "It's time to fly."</p>
<p>In January two thousand three, the Department of Homeland Security opened for business.</p>
<p>ANNOUNCER: "Maybe you see something suspicious, but you don't want to get involved. It's nothing, you think. Can you be sure?"</p>
<p>There was a lot to do.</p>
<p>ANNOUNCER: "If you see something, say something. Report suspicious activity to local authorities."</p>
<p>Transportation security, immigration, law enforcement, border protection. It represented the biggest government reorganization in more than half a century. All or part of twenty-two federal agencies and departments were combined into the new agency. Its job: to keep America safe in a world that had changed in a single day.</p>

<p>The War on Terror, which began after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States, escalated in March 2003, when a coalition of American-led forces invaded Iraq. The mission, as stated by President Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, was "to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, to end Saddam Hussein's support for terrorism, and to free the Iraqi people."</p>
<p>The war in Iraq will be our story next week.</p>

Its targets were world-famous buildings representing America's economic and military power.</span></span></div>
<div style="color: #000000; font-family: Tahoma; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; font-size: small; margin-top: 6pt; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Al-Qaida operatives hijacked four American passenger airplanes. The hijackers were from Middle Eastern countries. Each group included a pilot trained to fly two kinds of Boeing airliners, the 757 and the 767.</span></span></div>
<div style="color: #000000; font-family: Tahoma; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; font-size: small; margin-top: 6pt; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">At eight forty-six on that morning, one group of hijackers flew a Boeing 767 into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City. Seventeen minutes later, another group flew a second 767 into the Trade Center's South Tower.</span></span></div>

The plane exploded against a wall of the huge building where more than twenty thousand people worked.</span></span></div>

But some of the passengers on that flight, United 93, had heard about the terrorist attacks through phone calls to their families. Several passengers and crew members attempted to retake control of the plane. It crashed near the town of Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Investigators later said the hijackers probably planned to attack the Capitol, a major government building in Washington, D.C., where Congress meets.</span></span></div>

Bush on 9/11, the attacks left Americans in a state of shock and disbelief. But that was soon replaced by anger and a resolve that this would not be allowed to happen again.</span></span></div>

New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was asked if Arab-American or Muslim groups in New York might be targeted due to the nature of the attacks.</span></span></div>

They will receive extra protection. Nobody should engage in group blame. The particular individuals responsible, the groups responsible, that's up to law enforcement, and it's up to the United States government to figure out. And citizens of New York should -- even if they have anger, which is understandable, and very, very strong emotions about this -- it isn't their place to get involved in this. Then, they're just participating in the kind of activity we've just witnessed, and New Yorkers are not like that."</span></span></div>

<p>STEVE EMBER: Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION – American history in VOA Special English. I'm Steve Ember.</p>
<p>This week in our series, we look at America after the events of September eleventh, two thousand one.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>DAN RATHER: "A stunning and cowardly strike on the United States. Terrorists send mighty skyscrapers crumbling to the ground. Many innocent people are dead. The president vows the killers will pay for this attack on America."</p>
<p>The United States changed as a result of the September eleventh terrorist attacks. CBS newsman Dan Rather expressed what many Americans were feeling.</p>
<p>DAN RATHER: "You will remember this day as long as you live. A series of coordinated terror strikes today at this country, its people, our freedom. Strikes that came without warning."</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>On the morning of that sunny September day that came to be known as 9/11, the nation came under attack from al-Qaida, an extremist group led by Osama bin Laden. Its targets were world-famous buildings representing America's economic and military power.</p>
<p>Al-Qaida operatives hijacked four American passenger airplanes. The hijackers were from Middle Eastern countries. Each group included a pilot trained to fly two kinds of Boeing airliners, the 757 and the 767.</p>
<p>At eight forty-six on that morning, one group of hijackers flew a Boeing 767 into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City. Seventeen minutes later, another group flew a second 767 into the Trade Center's South Tower.</p>
<p>The planes exploded in fireballs that sent clouds of smoke into the air. The intense heat of the burning jet fuel from the planes caused structural failures that brought down both buildings.</p>
<p>About an hour after the first plane hit the World Trade Center, another group of al-Qaida operatives flew a 757 airliner into the Pentagon, the headquarters of the Defense Department, in Arlington, Virginia. The plane exploded against a wall of the huge building where more than twenty thousand people worked.</p>
<p>A fourth group had taken control of another 757. But some of the passengers on that flight, United 93, had heard about the terrorist attacks through phone calls to their families. Several passengers and crew members attempted to retake control of the plane. It crashed near the town of Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Investigators later said the hijackers probably planned to attack the Capitol, a major government building in Washington, D.C., where Congress meets.</p>
<p>There was also concern that the White House could have been a target.</p>
<p>The 9/11 attacks saw the worst loss of lives on American soil since Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in nineteen forty-one. That attack caused the United States to enter World War Two.</p>
<p>GEORGE W. BUSH: "The pictures of airplanes flying into buildings, fires burning, huge structures collapsing have filled us with disbelief, terrible sadness, and a quiet, unyielding anger."</p>
<p>As expressed by President George W. Bush on 9/11, the attacks left Americans in a state of shock and disbelief. But that was soon replaced by anger and a resolve that this would not be allowed to happen again.</p>
<p>GEORGE W. BUSH: "These acts of mass murder were intended to frighten our nation into chaos and retreat. But they have failed. Our country is strong. A great people has been moved to defend a great nation.</p>
<p>"Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings, but they can not touch the foundation of America. These acts shatter steel, but they can not dent the steel of American resolve."</p>
<p>At Ground Zero, the site of the World Trade Center destruction, rescue efforts continued into the night. New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was asked if Arab-American or Muslim groups in New York might be targeted due to the nature of the attacks.</p>
<p>RUDY GIULIANI: "Just the opposite. They will receive extra protection. Nobody should engage in group blame. The particular individuals responsible, the groups responsible, that's up to law enforcement, and it's up to the United States government to figure out. And citizens of New York should -- even if they have anger, which is understandable, and very, very strong emotions about this -- it isn't their place to get involved in this. Then, they're just participating in the kind of activity we've just witnessed, and New Yorkers are not like that."</p>
<p>And Giuliani spoke of the strength of the spirit of the people of his city.</p>
<p>GIULIANI: "People tonight should say a prayer for the people that we've lost, and be grateful that we're all here. Tomorrow, New York is going to be here, and we're going to rebuild, and we're going to be stronger than we were before."</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>On September twentieth, President Bush went before a joint session of Congress to declare a war on terror.</p>
<p>GEORGE W. BUSH: "Our war on terror begins with al-Qaida, but it does not end there. It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated. [Applause]"</p>
<p>President Bush explained that the war on terror would be different from other wars.</p>
<p>GEORGE W. BUSH: "Our response involves far more than instant retaliation and isolated strikes. Americans should not expect one battle, but a lengthy campaign, unlike any other we have ever seen. It may include dramatic strikes, visible on TV, and covert operations, secret even in success. We will starve terrorists of funding, turn them one against another, drive them from place to place, until there is no refuge or no rest. And we will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism.</p>
<p>"Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists. [Applause] From this day forward, any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime."</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>President Bush demanded that the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan stop sheltering Osama bin Laden and surrender him. The president also called on the Taliban to close terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The Taliban refused. They demanded evidence that Osama bin Laden had been involved in the attacks of 9/11. They said that if such evidence was provided, he would be tried in an Islamic court. The United States refused to provide evidence.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>On October seventh, the United States and Britain launched air strikes against Taliban targets. What became known as the War on Terror had begun.</p>
<p>Tribal groups from the opposition Northern Alliance led a ground attack. But suicide bombers had killed their leader, Ahmad Shah Masood, on September ninth, two days before the 9/11 attacks.</p>
<p>By November, Taliban control began to collapse in several provinces. Taliban forces fled Kabul, the capital. But the ouster of the Taliban government did not mean the end of the war on terror.</p>
<p>Some of President Bush's advisers had long supported an invasion of Iraq. As early as October two thousand one, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld suggested that military action against Iraq was possible. Government officials accused Iraq of having links to terrorist groups like al-Qaida. They noted that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had used chemical weapons. And they said he was seeking to develop biological and nuclear weapons as well.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>In October, two thousand one, Congress passed the U.S.A. Patriot Act. This law provided the government with more power to gather information about suspected terrorists in the United States. Critics said the law invaded constitutional rights to privacy. Civil liberties groups said the Patriot Act gave law enforcement and other agencies too much power.</p>
<p>In January two thousand two, President Bush gave his State of the Union report to Congress. He accused some nations of supporting terrorist organizations. He said the United States would not wait to be attacked by such groups. Instead, it would strike first at the countries that sheltered them. The president identified three nations – North Korea, Iran and Iraq -- as supporters of terror.</p>
<p>GEORGE W. BUSH: "States like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred."</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>In two thousand two, the United States opened a detention center at its naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Some of the fighters arrested in Afghanistan were sent there. They were not considered prisoners of war. Instead, the detainees were treated as "unlawful enemy combatants." As such, the Bush administration said they did not have the same rights as war prisoners under international treaties.</p>
<p>In the United States, the government also detained some foreign citizens, mostly for violating immigration laws. No terrorism charges were brought against these detainees. Human rights activists and some legal experts protested the detentions.</p>
<p>After 9/11, government agencies were criticized for failing to prevent the terrorist attacks. Critics said the agencies should have been working together to gather intelligence. Government officials said part of the issue involved legal restrictions on the gathering and sharing of intelligence.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>The attacks of 9/11 had a major effect on the commercial aviation industry. The skies over Washington and other cities became strangely silent.</p>
<p>Washington's busy Ronald Reagan National Airport was closed for several weeks after the attacks. When it reopened, new security measures for inspecting passengers and their belongings were put in place. Similar measures were in force at other airports across the nation.</p>
<p>Fears over safety among the traveling public led to a drop in the number of airline passengers. As a result, the airlines began to use smaller planes. Costly changes were necessary to "harden" the cockpit, to prevent more terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>The increased security led to delays and other problems. But slowly, Americans began to fly again in greater numbers. But airlines had to work hard to win back the trust of the traveling public.</p>
<p>(SOUND: United Airlines commercial)</p>
<p>One carrier, United, ran a low-key television advertising campaign, in which actor Robert Redford, at the end of each ad gently suggested</p>
<p>ROBERT REDFORD: "It's time to fly."</p>
<p>In January two thousand three, the Department of Homeland Security opened for business.</p>
<p>ANNOUNCER: "Maybe you see something suspicious, but you don't want to get involved. It's nothing, you think. Can you be sure?"</p>
<p>There was a lot to do.</p>
<p>ANNOUNCER: "If you see something, say something. Report suspicious activity to local authorities."</p>
<p>Transportation security, immigration, law enforcement, border protection. It represented the biggest government reorganization in more than half a century. All or part of twenty-two federal agencies and departments were combined into the new agency. Its job: to keep America safe in a world that had changed in a single day.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>The War on Terror, which began after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States, escalated in March 2003, when a coalition of American-led forces invaded Iraq. The mission, as stated by President Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, was "to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, to end Saddam Hussein's support for terrorism, and to free the Iraqi people."</p>
<p>The war in Iraq will be our story next week.</p>

<p>JIM TEDDER: I’m Jim Tedder.</p>
<p>CHRISTOPHER CRUISE: And I’m Christpher Cruise with EXPLORATIONS in VOA Special English. Today, we tell about an effort to destroy unused spacecraft and other objects floating high above the Earth. We also have news about SETI -- the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>JIM TEDDER: It just may be the world’s most costly vacuum cleaner. The price of CleanSpace One is eleven million dollars. But yet, it has a big job to do. Recently, researchers in Switzerland announced plans to build this new cleaning device. The researchers work at the Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne.</p>
<p>CleanSpace One will not be for use in homes or businesses. It will be shot into space to help remove the thousands of pieces of space junk floating around up there.</p>
<p>CHRISTOPHER CRUISE: Last year, we reported on the problem of space junk. Over time, many unused spacecraft have hit each other far above the Earth. Big pieces break into thousands of small pieces. Sometimes they fall back into the atmosphere and burn up. But when they do not, it creates big problems.</p>
<p>Scientists fear that if something is not done to remove these objects, it may soon become too dangerous to send people and machines into space. There is a large chance that they might crash into some of this junk. So that is why the Swiss researchers are developing the new device.</p>
<p>JIM TEDDER: CleanSpace One is not really a vacuum cleaner. It will not be used to take away space junk. But scientists plan to move it close to an old satellite that is no longer being used. Then a claw-like instrument will seize the satellite, and force it back through the atmosphere. There, the satellite will be destroyed by the heat of friction with the air.</p>
<p>Researchers say that all they need to do is slow down the speed of some of these unwanted objects. Once these items begin to move more slowly, they will fall back to Earth. There is little chance that they will fall through the atmosphere and harm the people or things below. Some space junk has returned to Earth, but it usually causes no harm as it falls into the ocean.</p>
<p>CHRISTOPHER CRUISE: The American space agency NASA and scientific organizations in other countries know that space junk is a serious problem. They are tracking the movement of over twenty thousand unwanted items circling the Earth. Some people have suggested using lasers to push the items into a lower and slower orbit.</p>
<p>NASA recently gave money to a South Carolina company that hopes to make a device called Eddy. That is the short name for ElectroDynamic Debris Eliminator. Eddy would work like the Swiss space cleaner. But it would use a net to catch an old satellite like a fish before sending it back through the atmosphere.</p>
<p>JIM TEDDER: John L. Junkins is an aerospace engineer with Texas A and M University. He says we need to remove five or six large space objects each year to stop what he calls the cascading effect. That is what happens when large objects, some as big as a bus, crash together. When they break apart, they create thousands of smaller parts that continue floating around the Earth. Professor Junkins says we would need to remove ten large pieces of space junk each year to stop the damage they might cause.</p>

<p>CHRISTOPHER CRUISE: While some scientists are watching things circling the Earth, others are searching the sky for something that is not made by humans. SETI -- the search for extraterrestrial intelligence -- is back on the job. But the question is: for how long? SETI has been searching the stars for nearly thirty years. But its scientists say the group has never had enough money. Last year, SETI suspended operations for a time. But the general public and some very wealthy people have given enough money to re-start the project.</p>
<p>JIM TEDDER: In February, SETI scientists began asking the public to help them with their research. The scientists are using a website to re-direct radio signals over the Internet. They have asked the public to use home computers, and their ears, to search for anything unusual. They hope the human brain can find things that their automated equipment cannot.</p>
<p>SETI’s telescopes and computers examine many different radio frequencies every day. But they ignore some frequencies because there are just too many radio signals in the air at any one time. The scientists hope that home computers will find an unusual sound “hidden” within sounds made by the technologies we use every day. In other words, they think that an alien radio signal might be covered up by the powerful signal of a local radio station.</p>
<p>CHRISTOPHER CRUISE: Much of SETI’s work involves the Allen Telescope Array -- over forty radio telescopes located in northeastern California. Scientists there point the circular antennas at an area of the sky called Cygnus. They are hoping to hear some signal or noise that is being sent into space by intelligent life. They hope to answer perhaps the biggest scientific question: are we alone in the universe? The area of the sky being searched seems large. But it really is a small part of the whole universe.</p>
<p>JIM TEDDER: For many years, researchers thought our solar system, the sun with Earth and the other planets, was a very special place. But that has changed. Researchers now believe there are billions of stars like our sun with planets orbiting around them. They also think that many of these planets are able to support life as we know it.</p>
<p>Long before SETI, an astronomer named Frank Drake began searching the skies for radio signals. In nineteen sixty, he worked at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in West Virginia. He is almost sure that we are not alone. Using a mathematical model he created, he estimates that there are ten thousand places in our part of the universe where life exists.</p>

<p>CHRISTOPHER CRUISE: After looking at millions of stars and listening to radio noise for many years, have scientists ever found anything that suggests there is intelligent alien life? The answer is: maybe. It happened one night in nineteen seventy-seven. A large radio telescope in Ohio heard something that made the scientists say, “Wow.”</p>
<p>The telescope was connected to a computer and a printer. The gathered information usually showed a series of low numbers, ones, twos, and threes. That meant that all the device was hearing was low level "background” noise, similar to the sound you hear when you set your radio between stations. But suddenly, something surprising happened. For a little over one minute, the noise level rose to a level thirty times what was usually heard. For seventy-two seconds, it appeared to some that our distant space brothers and sisters had finally said, “Hello.” When Jerry Ehman, a SETI scientist saw what the printer had produced, he drew a circle on the page in red ink and wrote, “Wow.”</p>
<p>JIM TEDDER: But just as suddenly as the signal had started, it stopped. And it has never been found again. So, what was it? What might it have been? Those questions have been on the mind of Robert Gray for years. He is an astronomer who recently finished work on a book called “The Elusive Wow.” He says that the information gathered in Ohio in nineteen seventy-seven looks exactly like a radio signal. He also says it is not likely that an airplane or a satellite was the cause.</p>
<p>Mr. Gray found that the “Wow” signal was very close to the number of vibrations per second of hydrogen when it gives off light. Hydrogen is the most common element in the universe. So some scientists think an intelligent alien would use its “glow frequency” as a radio signal. But why did the signal suddenly appear and then just as quickly disappear?</p>
<p>CHRISTOPHER CRUISE: Robert Gray calls that the “lighthouse effect.” If you were on a ship at sea and saw a lighthouse beam in the distance, it would appear to come and go across the night sky. It would not stay in one place. Mr. Gray says that might describe what aliens would do. They would sweep a radio signal to different parts of the sky, rather than just send it to one place. That way it might be seen, or heard, by more telescopes in many different places.</p>
<p>Mr. Gray thinks that in a hundred years, scientists will have far better equipment to examine the distant stars. We might be able to look at the entire known universe at one time instead of just examining such a small part of it. That should increase the chances that we will hear from our distant neighbors -- if they are out there.</p>

But they ignore some frequencies because there are just too many radio signals in the air at any one time. The scientists hope that home computers will find an unusual sound “hidden” within sounds made by the technologies we use every day. In other words, they think that an alien radio signal might be covered up by the powerful signal of a local radio station.</span></span></div>

Scientists there point the circular antennas at an area of the sky called “Cygnus.” They are hoping to hear some signal or noise that is being sent into space by intelligent life. They hope to answer perhaps the biggest scientific question: are we alone in the universe? The area of the sky being searched seems large.

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>VOICE TWO:</p>
<p>And I’m __________ with EXPLORATIONS in VOA Special English. Today, we tell about an effort to destroy unused spacecraft and other objects floating high above the Earth. We also have news about SETI -- the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>JIM TEDDER:</p>
<p>It just may be the world’s most costly vacuum cleaner. The price of “CleanSpace One” is eleven million dollars. But yet, it has a big job to do. Recently, researchers in Switzerland announced plans to build this new cleaning device. The researchers work at the Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne.</p>
<p>“CleanSpace One” will not be for use in homes or businesses. It will be shot into space to help remove the thousands of pieces of space junk floating around up there.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>VOICE TWO:</p>
<p>Last year, we reported on the problem of space junk. Over time, many unused spacecraft have hit each other far above the Earth. Big pieces break into thousands of small pieces. Sometimes they fall back into the atmosphere and burn up. But when they do not, it creates big problems.</p>
<p>Scientists fear that if something is not done to remove these objects, it may soon become too dangerous to send people and machines into space. There is a large chance that they might crash into some of this junk. So that is why the Swiss researchers are developing the new device.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>JIM TEDDER:</p>
<p>“CleanSpace One” is not really a vacuum cleaner. It will not be used to take away space junk. But scientists plan to move it close to an old satellite that is no longer being used. Then a claw-like instrument will seize the satellite, and force it back through the atmosphere. There, the satellite will be destroyed by the heat of friction with the air.</p>
<p>Researchers say that all they need to do is slow down the speed of some of these unwanted objects. Once these items begin to move more slowly, they will fall back to Earth. There is little chance that they will fall through the atmosphere and harm the people or things below. Some space junk has returned to Earth, but it usually causes no harm as it falls into the ocean.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>VOICE TWO:</p>
<p>The American space agency NASA and scientific organizations in other countries know that space junk is a serious problem. They are tracking the movement of over twenty thousand unwanted items circling the Earth. Some people have suggested using lasers to push the items into a lower and slower orbit.</p>
<p>NASA recently gave money to a South Carolina company that hopes to make a device called “Eddy”. That is the short name for “ElectroDynamic Debris Eliminator.” “Eddy” would work like the Swiss space cleaner. But it would use a net to catch an old satellite like a fish before sending it back through the atmosphere.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>JIM TEDDER:</p>
<p>John L. Junkins is an aerospace engineer with Texas A and M University. He says we need to remove five or six large space objects each year to stop what he calls the “cascading effect.” That is what happens when large objects, some as big as a bus, crash together. When they break apart, they create thousands of smaller parts that continue floating around the Earth. Professor Junkins says we would need to remove ten large pieces of space junk each year to stop the damage they might cause.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>VOICE TWO:</p>
<p>While some scientists are watching things circling the Earth, others are searching the sky for something that is not made by humans. SETI -- the search for extraterrestrial intelligence -- is back on the job. But the question is: for how long? SETI has been searching the stars for nearly thirty years. But its scientists say the group has never had enough money. Last year, SETI suspended operations for a time. But the general public and some very wealthy people have given enough money to re-start the project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>JIM TEDDER:</p>
<p>In February, SETI scientists began asking the public to help them with their research. The scientists are using a website to re-direct radio signals over the Internet. They have asked the public to use home computers, and their ears, to search for anything unusual. They hope the human brain can find things that their automated equipment cannot.</p>
<p>SETI’s telescopes and computers examine many different radio frequencies every day. But they ignore some frequencies because there are just too many radio signals in the air at any one time. The scientists hope that home computers will find an unusual sound “hidden” within sounds made by the technologies we use every day. In other words, they think that an alien radio signal might be covered up by the powerful signal of a local radio station.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>VOICE TWO:</p>
<p>Much of SETI’s work involves the Allen Telescope Array -- over forty radio telescopes located in northeastern California. Scientists there point the circular antennas at an area of the sky called “Cygnus.” They are hoping to hear some signal or noise that is being sent into space by intelligent life. They hope to answer perhaps the biggest scientific question: are we alone in the universe? The area of the sky being searched seems large. But it really is a small part of the whole universe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>JIM TEDDER:</p>
<p>For many years, researchers thought our solar system, the sun with Earth and the other planets, was a very special place. But that has changed. Researchers now believe there are billions of stars like our sun with planets orbiting around them. They also think that many of these planets are able to support life as we know it.</p>
<p>Long before SETI, an astronomer named Frank Drake began searching the skies for radio signals. In nineteen sixty, he worked at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in West Virginia. He is almost sure that we are not alone. Using a mathematical model he created, he estimates that there are ten thousand places in our part of the universe where life exists.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>VOICE TWO:</p>
<p>After looking at millions of stars and listening to radio noise for many years, have scientists ever found anything that suggests there is intelligent alien life? The answer is: maybe. It happened one night in nineteen seventy-seven. A large radio telescope in Ohio heard something that made the scientists say, “Wow.”</p>
<p>The telescope was connected to a computer and a printer. The gathered information usually showed a series of low numbers, ones, twos, and threes. That meant that all the device was hearing was low level “background” noise, similar to the sound you hear when you set your radio between stations. But suddenly, something surprising happened. For a little over one minute, the noise level rose to a level thirty times what was usually heard. For seventy-two seconds, it appeared to some that our distant space brothers and sisters had finally said, “Hello.” When Jerry Ehman, a SETI scientist saw what the printer had produced, he drew a circle on the page in red ink and wrote, “Wow.”</p>

So some scientists think an intelligent alien would use its “glow frequency” as a radio signal. But why did the signal suddenly appear and then just as quickly disappear?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>VOICE TWO:</p>
<p>Robert Gray calls that the “lighthouse effect.” If you were on a ship at sea and saw a lighthouse beam in the distance, it would appear to come and go across the night sky. It would not stay in one place. Mr. Gray says that might describe what aliens would do. They would sweep a radio signal to different parts of the sky, rather than just send it to one place. That way it might be seen, or heard, by more telescopes in many different places.</p>
<p>Mr. Gray thinks that in a hundred years, scientists will have far better equipment to examine the distant stars.

<p>This is the VOA Special English Education Report.</p>
<p>About ten percent of spending on primary and secondary education in the United States comes from the federal government. For ten years now, federal law has tied this spending to student performance. States have been required to show progress through yearly testing.</p>
<p>But states say testing tells only part of the story about efforts by schools and students to improve. So the Obama administration has eased the limits on states in measuring performance.</p>
<p>The western state of Colorado, for example, has a new assessment method. This new measurement tool is called the Colorado Growth Model. The idea is to show academic growth, not just achievement on tests. It combines test scores, family income levels, school size, the ethnicity of the student and many other factors.</p>
<p>Bill Bonk is one of the creators of the Colorado Growth Model.</p>
<p><span class="margin-bottom-small display-block container field-note"> &lt;!--IMAGE-LEFT--&gt;</span>BILL BONK: "A big part of that has been the calculation of academic growth. It’s a very fancy calculation. We’re very proud of it."</p>
<p>The results from schools across the state are shown online on a graph. The graph shows a school’s average score on standardized tests as well as its academic growth.</p>
<p>Josh Smith is principal of a middle school in a network of public charter schools called West Denver Prep. Charter schools are publicly funded but not operated the same as traditional public schools. Mr. Smith says he likes to show his students this graph so they can see their school's progress.</p>
<p>Many of his students have parents who do not speak English. He likes to play word games with his students, like having them expand their vocabulary by finding another way to say "I’m good."</p>
<p>JOSH SMITH: "Good morning, Daisy."</p>
<p>STUDENT: "Good morning, Mr. Smith."</p>
<p>JOSH SMITH: "How are you this morning?"</p>
<p>STUDENT: "Phenomenal."</p>
<p>JOSH SMITH: "Phenomenal! I love it."</p>
<p>Eighth grader Juan Soltero says games like these, and studying hard, have helped raise his expectations for himself. He says he wants to be an electrical engineer.</p>
<p>JUAN SOLTERO: "The teachers, they really want you to learn. They really do love you.  They give you support and talk you through things. It’s not just about academics. You have to be comfortable in learning so you can just stick it in your head."</p>
<p>On average, students enter sixth grade at West Denver Prep performing below grade level. But three years later, most are outperforming other students across the state.</p>
<p>The new assessment method shows that, each year, the average West Denver Prep student learns more math than ninety-four percent of all the students in Colorado. Reading and writing scores also show growth.</p>
<p>Josh Smith says perhaps the most important thing they should learn is to believe in themselves.</p>
<p>And that's the VOA Special English Education Report. You can watch a video about West Denver Prep and the Colorado Growth Model at voaspecialenglish.com. We also have captioned videos of our reports at the VOA Learning English channel on YouTube. I'm Christopher Cruise.</p>

<p>This is the VOA Special English Health Report.</p>
<p>A new <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2012/03/21/science.1219328.abstract">study</a> suggests that early exposure to germs strengthens the immune system. That means letting children get a little dirty might be good for their health later in life.</p>
<p>The study involved laboratory mice. It found that adult mice raised in a germ-free environment were more likely to develop allergies, asthma and other autoimmune disorders. There are more than eighty disorders where cells that normally defend the body instead attack tissues and organs.</p>
<p>They include rheumatoid arthritis, which attacks the joints; Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel condition; and juvenile diabetes. Hay fever, a common allergy, is also an autoimmune disorder.</p>
<p><span class="margin-bottom-small display-block container field-note"> &lt;!--IMAGE-LEFT--&gt;</span>Richard Blumberg is a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. He says in nineteen eighty-nine, medical researchers sought to explain these diseases with what they called the "hygiene hypothesis." They proposed that the increasing use of antibacterial soaps and other products, especially early in life, could weaken immune systems.</p>
<p>RICHARD BLUMBERG: "The hypothesis has stated or suggested that early-life exposure to microbes is a very important determinant of later life sensitivity to allergic and so-called autoimmune diseases, such as hay fever, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease and others."</p>
<p>Now, Dr. Blumberg and a team have what they say is the first biological evidence to link early exposure to germs to stronger adult immune systems. They say this exposure could prevent the development of some autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p>In the adult germ-free mice, they found that inflammation in the lungs and colon was caused by so-called killer T cells. These normally fight infection. But they became overactive and targeted healthy tissue -- an autoimmune condition seen in asthma and a disease called ulcerative colitis.</p>
<p>Dr. Blumberg says the mice raised in a normal environment did not have the same reaction. He says their immune systems had been "educated" by early exposure to germs.</p>
<p>RICHARD BLUMBERG: "What was really most remarkable to us was the fact that once the education event provided by the microbes occurred in early life, it was durable and lasted throughout the life of the animal."</p>
<p>Rates of autoimmune disorders are rising worldwide, but mostly in wealthier, industrialized countries.</p>
<p>RICHARD BLUMBERG: "I think one obvious question, for example, that’s raised by these studies is the early life use of antibiotics and whether we need to be more careful in their prescribing."</p>
<p>Rob Dunn is a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. He says the new study does not mean people should stop washing.</p>
<p>ROB DUNN: "Wash your hands, but don't do it with antimicrobial soap. Let your kids play in a reasonable amount of dirt and get outside and get exposed to a diversity of things."</p>
<p>The study appears in the journal Science.</p>

<p>This is the VOA Special English Agriculture Report.</p>
<p>Bees add an estimated eighteen billion dollars a year to the value of American crops. They pollinate flowers that become fruits, nuts and vegetables. But, in recent years, honeybee colonies in the United States and Europe have been shrinking. Scientists have proposed different theories to explain what is known as colony collapse disorder.</p>
<p>New research suggests that a commonly used group of insecticides could cause bees to have a hard time finding their way back to their hive.</p>
<p>The new research looks at the use of pesticides called neonicotinoids. They were first used in the nineteen nineties. They are now put on the seeds of many major crops around the world. The seedlings absorb the chemical as they grow.</p>
<p>That means farmers do not need to spray a whole field. Instead there is a little bit of insecticide inside each plant -- including the pollen and nectar that the bees want.</p>
<p>There is not enough pesticide to kill them. But the new research in the journal Science says it may harm them anyway.</p>
<p>Researchers stuck microchips to the backs of the bees. These chips recorded the bees' movements as they came and went from their hive. The scientists fed some bees sugar water with a low dose of a neonicotinoid. The study found that these bees were about twice as likely not to return as other bees.</p>
<p>Mickael Henry from INRA, the French national agriculture research institute, says the bees basically get drunk.</p>
<p>MICKAEL HENRY: "Intoxicated honeybees with those small doses may just get lost and are not able to find their way back home."</p>
<p>For some crops around the world, wild pollinators like bumblebees are more important than honeybees. Dave Goulson at the University of Sterling in Britain worked on another study published in Science. He says the pesticides could help explain why bumblebee populations are also decreasing.</p>
<p>DAVE GOULSON: "There were eighty-five percent fewer queens produced when they’d been exposed to realistic field levels."</p>
<p>Bayer CropScience makes neonicotinoid pesticides. Company spokesman Jack Boyne disputed the findings.</p>
<p>JACK BOYNE: "Instead of dosing the animals at field-relevant concentrations as the authors intended, they instead dosed them at levels far greater than what would commonly be experienced in the field."</p>
<p>He also notes that researchers are studying other factors that could affect bee populations. These include parasites, diseases and stress caused by transporting beehives to farms.</p>
<p>Some European countries have banned the pesticides. And there are growing calls to ban them in the United States as well.</p>

<p>BARBARA KLEIN: This is SCIENCE IN THE NEWS, in VOA Special English. I’m Barbara Klein.</p>
<p>MARIO RITTER: And I’m Mario Ritter. Wildlife experts are concerned about the growing number of elephants and rhinoceros being killed in Africa. Today we tell about the issue, and about some efforts to help the animals.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>BARBARA KLEIN: The nation of Cameroon recently suffered one of the worst mass killings of elephants in years. Up to four hundred fifty of the animals have been found dead in the country’s Bouba Ndjida National Park since January.</p>
<p>A United Nations agency expressed deep concern over the killings. John Scanlon is head of CITES -- the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.</p>
<p>A CITES study showed an increase in the number of elephant kills in two thousand eleven. Secretary-General Scanlon said people are killing the animals for ivory – the substance that makes up their tusks. He said the deaths are a major concern not only for Cameroon but for all areas where African elephants live.</p>
<p>MARIO RITTER: The CITES chief said the incident shows that a new poaching problem is taking place. He said poachers are using high-powered weapons to destroy elephant populations. Reports say groups from Chad and Sudan have attacked elephants during recent weeks. The hunters are thought to sell the ivory to get money, weapons and ammunition for armed conflicts.</p>
<p>CITES is offering African governments support for catching the hunters, and seizing the poached ivory. Countries where poachers pass through or trade are being asked to cooperate. And CITES has appointed its chief enforcement officer to organize an effort to respond to major elephant poaching.</p>
<p>BARBARA KLEIN:The government in Cameroon also has attempted to help elephants. On March first, it sent as many as one hundred fifty soldiers to the Bouba Ndjida National Park. They were deployed in an effort to save the remaining elephants. But a World Wildlife Fund official said another twenty elephants were killed after the soldiers arrived. Another Fund official described the effort as too little, too late.</p>
<p>The CITES study was the second recent one on elephant-poaching from Africa. The first came last month from the animal warden at a U.N. World Heritage Site in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He said poaching is so severe that dogs are trained and used to follow poachers.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>MARIO RITTER: Like elephant tusks, rhinoceros horns have great value when sold. Some observers say people from Asia are paying high prices for jewelry and other objects made from elephant ivory. They also say more Asians are demanding rhino horns for use as medicine. The horns contain keratin, a protein substance found in material including hair.</p>
<p>In South Africa, thirteen rhinoceros were killed for their horns in two thousand seven. Four years later, almost four hundred fifty rhinoceros were killed in just twelve months. The losses include both white rhinoceros and the smaller, black rhinoceros. Strangely, both animals are a gray-brown color instead of white or black, as their names suggest.</p>
<p>BARBARA KLEIN: Twenty ten was also a record year for rhinoceros kills in South Africa, the world’s largest homeland for rhinos. Three hundred thirty three rhinos were lost to poachers during that time. The hunters cut off the rhino’s horn while a drug makes the animal unable to move. Many times the rhino is left to bleed to death. Or it never recovers from its drugged condition.</p>
<p>It is easy to understand why poachers want the horns. The International Rhino Foundation says the price of one is close to fifty seven thousand dollars a kilogram. Others place it much higher.</p>
<p>Lucy Boddam-Whetham works for the group Save the Rhino International. She is very concerned.</p>
<p>LUCY BODDAM-WHETHAM:  “We are incredibly worried at the moment.  We are actually facing the worst rhino poaching crisis for decades.”</p>
<p><span class="margin-bottom-small display-block container field-note">&lt;!--IMAGE-LEFT--&gt;</span>Rhino poaching is not new. Rhino horns have been used for centuries in traditional human medicines. The horn has been thought to effectively treat high body temperatures and head pain. But recently, false reports have spread that rhino horn material can cure cancer. The reports are perhaps responsible for the huge increase in poaching.</p>
<p>MARIO RITTER: Tom Milliken studies international trade in wildlife products for the organization Traffic International. He says rhino horn cannot cure anything, let alone cancer.</p>
<p>Mr. Milliken directs Traffic International’s operations in southern and eastern Africa from Zimbabwe. He says the horn is usually ground into small pieces. These are mixed with medicines to form a pill that is swallowed. Or, he said it can be ground and mixed with water and drunk as a liquid.</p>
<p>Mr. Milliken says rhino horn is especially popular in Vietnam, where it is being sold for home use. An industry there manufactures small containers for grinding the powder at home.</p>
<p>Ms. Boddam-Whetham says many Asians have enough money to buy costly rhino horn products. She also notes the growth of trade links between Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>BARBARA KLEIN: What can be done to save the rhino population from falling in South Africa?</p>
<p>One idea being tried is removing a rhino’s horn to prevent the animal from being killed illegally. Many ranchers who raise rhinoceros for profit support this idea. That includes some whose animals were killed for their horns. The landowners say horns removed humanely then would be available for the market, reducing the price. And poachers would not attack rhinos without horns.</p>
<p>Another idea that has been proposed is making the sale of rhino horn legal. Activists for that plan say it would reduce criminal activity.</p>
<p>MARIO RITTER: Dr. Jacques Flamand is a wildlife specialist in South Africa. He has been working to help rhinos in other ways. These methods also involve ranchers.</p>
<p><span class="margin-bottom-small display-block container field-note">&lt;!--IMAGE-LEFT--&gt;</span>Earlier in Dr. Flamand’s career, he became known for helping to rescue the white rhino population from disappearing forever. Now he is leading the Black Rhino Range Expansion Project. Its goal is to increase the home territories of rare black rhinos, which can raise their numbers. The activist organizations WWF and Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife are working to provide wider, safer spaces where the animals can move freely.</p>
<p>BARBARA KLEIN: Over the years, Dr. Flamand supervised the transport of many black rhinos by helicopter. The process begins when the animals are given a drug that makes them sleepy. Then they are suspended upside down from the helicopter. They hang by their legs on strong ropes for a fast trip to another territory -- much faster than traveling by truck.</p>
<p>Veterinarians say the trip does not hurt the animals. Health experts watch them during the flight, after landing and during their release. And they say the creatures simply wake up in their new surroundings with much more space than before.</p>
<p>But Dr. Flamand said it was not always easy to get landowners to provide that space. Black rhinos interest many people, especially foreign tourists. But, as we know, they also get the attention of poachers. Not all landowners are interested in earning money from the tourist trade. Others are just not pleased to have two-ton visitors.</p>
<p>MARIO RITTER: Dr. Flamand told a VOA reporter that some landowners have combined their properties to create large areas. He said a lot of hard work was needed to persuade them. But now, many landowners have removed barriers that would have stopped rhinos from moving freely.</p>
<p>Recently, nineteen black rhinos were among a group of animals “translocated” to new territory. That brought the total population of the transported creatures to one hundred twenty.</p>
<p>Jacques Flamand says their rangeland territory has been expanded by thirty-four percent. Their safety has been improved. And landowners have increased security to protect the animals – and themselves – from poachers.</p>
<p>BARBARA KLEIN: Dr. Flamand says other wildlife also have gained more security and breeding space from the project.</p>
<p>JACQUES FLAMAND:  “It is not only good for black rhino. It is good for elephants, vultures and especially another critically endangered species, the wild dog.”</p>
<p>Many activists praise Dr. Flamand’s work for rhinos. Still, as one South African said, “Any animal with the possibility of that kind of value will always be in some danger.”</p>

<p>This is the VOA Special English Technology Report.</p>
<p>The Microsoft Corporation is making progress in efforts to stop one of the most harmful cybercrime operations active today. It is called Zeus.</p>
<p>Last week, an American judge ordered the group of cybercriminals to end their illegal activities. A week earlier, federal officials raided office buildings in two states and seized evidence related to the Zeus family of computer software. Richard Boscovich is with Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit.</p>
<p>RICHARD BOSCOVICH: “The objective was to go in there and be able to seize evidence which would lead us to hopefully identify the individuals behind the Zeus family of malware as well as ultimately identify the computers of people all over the world that are compromised. That is, that they have the malware on their computer. Their being victimized, being used to victimized others and they don’t even know about it.”</p>
<p>Cybercriminals use Zeus to create a network of infected computers, or botnet, to steal personal information from computer users. Mr. Boscovich says the operation reaches around the world.</p>
<p>RICHARD BOSCOVICH: “We’ve identified this particular malware was present at any particular point in time in at least thirteen million computers worldwide.”</p>
<p>Malware means malicious software. It also can be called a computer virus or worm. Mister Boscovich says it is mostly spread through a normal everyday activity.</p>
<p>RICHARD BOSCOVICH: “The malware is spread through emails where people inadvertently are tricked to click on a particular link on the email or visit a particular site. And once that happens, the objective is to infect the person’s computer with this piece of malware.”</p>
<p>The malware is programmed to record every key you strike on a computer keyboard. It gathers details about the websites you visit, your usernames and passwords, or other personal information. The information is then sent to the botnet’s command center.</p>
<p>RICHARD BOSCOVICH: “What that is is a location on the Internet. It could be domain based or IP based, where the criminals will direct all of these computers that they’ve infected to every once in a while literally call out to these domains or these IPs asking for directions.”</p>
<p>Much of the stolen information is sold on the black market. The information can be used to steal money from bank accounts or make purchases online without the victim’s knowledge. Officials say these malware invasions are one of the main causes of identity theft.</p>
<p>Microsoft brought a case against the Zeus operation on March nineteenth. The company released the details of the case after the buildings were raided on March twenty-third.</p>
<p>Next week, we will tell more about the raids, Zeus, and what Microsoft says computer users can do to protect themselves. We will also talk about other recent efforts to fight cybercrime.</p>

<p>JUNE SIMMS: Welcome to THIS IS AMERICA in VOA Special English. I'm June Simms.</p>
<p>Today, we tell about a federal law called the Stolen Valor Act of two thousand five. The act bars people from claiming they received military honors when they did not. Any violation is considered a crime.</p>
<p>Recently, the United States Supreme Court heard arguments for and against the law. Christopher Cruise went to the court hearing, and has our report.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p><span class="margin-bottom-small display-block container field-note">&lt;!--IMAGE-RIGHT--&gt;</span>CHRISTOPHER CRUISE: Let me begin with some history about the Stolen Valor Act. The Act was proposed in both houses of Congress in two thousand five. The measure easily won congressional approval. It became law after President George W. Bush added his signature in late two thousand six.</p>
<p>There were no congressional hearings on the act. And the debate in the House of Representatives lasted just twenty minutes.</p>
<p>Some federal judges and free-speech activists say the law is unconstitutional. They say this case is not about military honors, but about government power. But supporters of the law say it is necessary to protect both the honor of those who have received awards and the integrity of the military honors system. They say the case is about theft -- not about lying.</p>
<p>These competing arguments have made their way to what is sometimes called the highest court in the land -- the United States Supreme Court. It was asked whether the government should have the power to jail someone for claiming that they received a military honor when, in fact, they did not.</p>
<p>Some observers say the court is really being asked to decide what kinds of lies the federal government can punish. It is a case of free speech versus government power.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>The case is called the United States v. Xavier Alvarez. It all started because of comments made at a public meeting in southern California. Xavier Alvarez had been elected to the board of directors of a local water district. He spoke to other board members at a meeting in September two thousand seven.</p>
<p>His own lawyers admit that almost everything he said about himself at that meeting - other than his name - was a lie. Alvarez claimed he had been a police officer, a hockey player and an engineer. He said he was secretly married to a famous and beautiful young actress from Mexico. He also said he had even rescued the American ambassador during the Iranian hostage crisis in the nineteen seventies. None of that is true. But it also was not against the law for him to make those claims.</p>
<p>But then Xavier Alvarez said he was a retired United States Marine. He said he was wounded in battle and had been awarded the Medal of Honor. But Alvarez had never served in the Marines or retired from the armed forces. And he had never earned the country’s highest military honor. When he said he had, he broke the law.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>Lawyers for Xavier Alvarez say he was speaking as an official of an elected body when he lied about the medal. They say this shows he was “engaged in political speech.” And, they say, that kind of speech has always enjoyed “special protection” under the Constitution and court rulings.</p>
<p>There are fewer than ninety people alive who have received the Medal of Honor. Someone apparently suspected Mr. Alvarez was lying about being one of them. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was given a recording of the water board meeting. The FBI investigated and found that Alvarez had not earned <em>any</em> medals, let alone the Medal of Honor. He soon became one of the first people charged with violating the Stolen Valor Act.</p>
<p>He admitted guilt in court with the understanding that he would appeal the ruling. He was fined five thousand dollars and ordered to work without pay for over four hundred hours at a hospital for military veterans. This is known as community service. It is a way that judges can punish those found guilty of violating a law without sending them to prison.</p>
<p>People who violate the Stolen Valor Act <em>can</em> be sent to jail for six months for making claims about receiving lower-level awards. They can be jailed for up to one year for making claims about receiving higher-level awards like the Medal of Honor. However, most people convicted of violating the law are ordered to perform community service and are not jailed.</p>
<p>Xavier Alvarez appealed his conviction to a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The panel ruled two-to-one that the act is unconstitutional. Two judges said the law violated the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. The chief judge of the court said that if the Constitution leaves unprotected all lies, then we would all be considered criminals. Chief Judge Alex Kosinski said we lie for many reasons, and such lying should generally not be punished.</p>
<p>But another judge in a different court said the Stolen Valor Act does not violate the constitution. The judge said “false statements of fact do not enjoy constitutional protection.”</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>On the morning of Wednesday, February twenty-second, the United States Supreme Court heard arguments for and against the law. Lawyers representing each side of the issue presented their arguments. The court’s justices were very aggressive in their questioning of both sides.</p>
<p>Donald B. Verrilli Junior represented the government in the case. Mr. Verrilli is the solicitor general of the United States, the government lawyer who defends federal laws. He was asked by Chief Justice John Roberts whether the government has the power under the Constitution to make any lie illegal.</p>
<p>JOHN ROBERTS: “But where do you stop? I mean, there are many things that people know about themselves that are objectively verifiable where Congress would have an interest in protecting. High school diploma. It is a crime to state that you have a high school diploma if you know that you don’t. That’s something you can check pretty easily. And Congress can say: We want people to finish high school. It’s a big thing to have a high school diploma. So we want to make sure nobody goes around saying they do when they don’t. What about that case?”</p>
<p>Later, Solicitor General Verrilli said why the government wanted the court to find the law constitutional.</p>
<p>DONALD VERRILLI: “And I, what I think with respect to the government’s interest here and why there is a harm to that interest is that, the point of these medals is that it’s a big deal. You get one for doing something very important after a lot of scrutiny. And for the government to say this is a really big deal and then to stand idly by when one charlatan after another makes a false claim to have won the medal <em>does </em>debase the value of the medal in the eyes of the soldiers. It <em>does</em> do that. That <em>is</em> the government’s interest.”</p>
<p>Jonathan Libby is a deputy federal public defender. He represented Xavier Alvarez at the court hearing. Mister Libby admitted to the Court that the defendant is a liar. He was asked by Justice Samuel Alito if he believed the Constitution protects lies.</p>
<p>SAMUEL ALITO: “But you really think that there is, that the First Amendment, that there is First Amendment value in a bald-faced lie about a purely factual statement that a person makes about himself, because that person would like to create a particular persona? ‘Gee, I would, I won the Medal of Honor. I was a Rhodes scholar, I won the Nobel Prize.’ There’s a personal -- the First Amendment protects that?”</p>
<p>JONATHAN LIBBY: “Yes, your honor, so long as it doesn’t cause imminent harm to another person or imminent harm to a government function.”</p>
<p>After the hearing, Mr. Libby spoke to reporters.</p>
<p><span class="margin-bottom-small display-block container field-note"> &lt;!--IMAGE-LEFT--&gt;</span>JONATHAN LIBBY: “Well, it’s not OK to lie, generally. The issue is whether Congress can make it a crime to tell a lie, and the First Amendment would suggest that Congress doesn’t get to decide what we can and cannot say. What we’ve argued is there needs to be harm associated with the lie in order for it to be unprotected under the First Amendment. Here there was no harm as a result of what Mr. Alvarez said.</p>
<p>"If lies are not protected – have no protection, which is what the government seems to suggest here, then who knows where it could end? If there’s imminent harm that results from the lie, then you know that’s something that Congress has the right to worry about. If there’s not harm, then it shouldn’t matter where you say it or who you say it to.”</p>
<p>A video of Mr. Libby can be seen on our website, voaspecialenglish.com. Government lawyers did not speak to reporters following their oral arguments at the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The court will announce its decision before the end of June.</p>
<p>If the court says the Stolen Valor Act is unconstitutional, some members of the House of Representatives are ready. They have proposed a bill that would make lying about receiving a military honor illegal only if the person telling the lie planned to make money from it. That more narrowly-written law might be acceptable to the justices of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>As for Xavier Alvarez, he was found guilty in two thousand nine of stealing over four thousand dollars in public money. He was sentenced to five years in a California state prison. He was recently freed after meeting conditions for release.</p>

<p>SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: I’m Shirley Griffith.</p>
<p>SARAH LONG: And I’m Sarah Long with the VOA Special English program PEOPLE IN AMERICA. Today, we tell about one of the leaders of the birth control movement, Margaret Sanger.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: Many women today have the freedom to decide when they will have children, if they want them. Until about fifty years ago, women spent most of their adult lives having children, year after year. This changed because of efforts by activists like Margaret Sanger. She believed that a safe and sure method of preventing pregnancy was a necessary condition for women’s freedom. She also believed birth control was necessary for human progress.</p>
<p>Margaret Sanger was considered a rebel in the early nineteen hundreds.</p>
<p>SARAH LONG: The woman who changed other women’s lives was born in eighteen eighty three in the eastern state of New York. Her parents were Michael and Anne Higgins.</p>
<p>Margaret wrote several books about her life. She wrote that her father taught her to question everything. She said he taught her to be an independent thinker.</p>
<p>Margaret said that watching her mother suffer from having too many children made her feel strongly about birth control. Her mother died at forty-eight years of age after eighteen pregnancies. She was always tired and sick. Margaret had to care for her mother and her ten surviving brothers and sisters. This experience led her to become a nurse.</p>
<p>Margaret Higgins worked in the poor areas of New York City. Most people there had recently arrived in the United States from Europe. Margaret saw the suffering of hundreds of women who tried to end their pregnancies in illegal and harmful ways. She realized that this was not just a health problem. These women suffered because of their low position in society.</p>
<p>Margaret saw that not having control over one’s body led to problems that were passed on from mother to daughter and through the family for years. She said she became tired of cures that did not solve the real problem. Instead, she wanted to change the whole life of a mother.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: In nineteen two, Margaret married William Sanger. They had three children. Margaret compared her own middle-class life to that of the poor people she worked among. This increased her desire to deal with economic and social issues. At this time, Margaret Sanger became involved in the liberal political culture of an area of New York City known as Greenwich Village. Sanger became a labor union organizer. She learned methods of protest and propaganda, which she used in her birth control activism.</p>
<p>Sanger traveled to Paris, France, in nineteen thirteen, to research European methods of birth control. She also met with members of Socialist political groups who influenced her birth control policies. She returned to the United States prepared to change women’s lives.</p>
<p>SARAH LONG: At first, Margaret Sanger sought the support of leaders of the women’s movement, members of the Socialist party, and the medical profession. But, she wrote that they told her to wait until women were permitted to vote. She decided to continue working alone.</p>
<p>One of Margaret Sanger’s first important political acts was to publish a monthly newspaper called The Woman Rebel<em>.</em> She designed it. She wrote for it. And she paid for it. The newspaper called for women to reject the traditional woman’s position. The first copy was published in March nineteen fourteen.  The Woman Rebel was an angry paper that discussed disputed and sometimes illegal subjects. These included labor problems, marriage, the sex business, and revolution.</p>
<p>Sanger had an immediate goal. She wanted to change laws that prevented birth control education and sending birth control devices through the mail.</p>
<p>SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: The Woman Rebel became well-known in New York and elsewhere. Laws at that time banned the mailing of materials considered morally bad. This included any form of birth control information. The law was known as the Comstock Act.  Officials ordered Sanger to stop sending out her newspaper.</p>
<p>Sanger instead wrote another birth control document called Family Limitation. The document included detailed descriptions of birth control methods. In August, nineteen fourteen, Margaret Sanger was charged with violating the Comstock Act.</p>
<p>Margaret faced a prison sentence of as many as forty-five years if found guilty. She fled to Europe to escape the trial. She asked friends to release thousands of copies of Family Limitation. The document quickly spread among women across the United States. It started a public debate about birth control. The charges against Sanger also increased public interest in her and in women’s issues.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>SARAH LONG: Once again, Margaret Sanger used her time in Europe to research birth control methods. After about a year, she decided to return to the United States to face trial. She wanted to use the trial to speak out about the need for reproductive freedom for women.</p>
<p>While Sanger was preparing for her trial, her five-year-old daughter, Peggy, died of pneumonia. The death made Sanger feel very weak and guilty. However, the death greatly increased public support for Sanger and the issue of birth control. The many reports in the media caused the United States government to dismiss charges against her.</p>
<p>SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: Margaret Sanger continued to oppose the Comstock Act by opening the first birth control center in the United States. It opened in Brownsville, New York in nineteen sixteen. Sanger’s sister, Ethel Byrne, and a language expert helped her. One-hundred women came to the birth control center on the first day. After about a week, police arrested the three women, but later released them. Sanger immediately re-opened the health center, and was arrested again. The women were tried the next year. Sanger was sentenced to thirty days in jail.</p>
<p>With some support from women’s groups, Sanger started a new magazine, the Birth Control Review. In nineteen twenty-one, she organized the first American birth control conference. The conference led to the creation of the American Birth Control League. It was established to provide education, legal reform and research for better birth control. The group opened a birth control center in the United States in nineteen twenty-three. Many centers that opened later across the country copied this one.</p>
<p>Sanger was president of the American Birth Control League until nineteen twenty-eight. In the nineteen thirties she helped win a judicial decision that permitted American doctors to give out information about birth control.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>SARAH LONG: Historians say Margaret Sanger changed her methods of political action during and after the nineteen twenties. She stopped using direct opposition and illegal acts. She even sought support from her former opponents.</p>
<p>Later, Sanger joined supporters of eugenics. This is the study of human improvement by genetic control. Extremists among that group believe that disabled, weak or “undesirable” human beings should not be born. Historians say Sanger supported eugenicists only as a way to gain her birth control goals. She later said she was wrong in supporting eugenics. But she still is criticized for these statements.</p>
<p>SHIRLEY GRIFFITH: Even though Margaret Sanger changed her methods, she continued her efforts for birth control. In the nineteen forty-two, she helped form the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. It became a major national health organization after World War Two.</p>
<p>Margaret Sanger moved into areas of international activism. Her efforts led to the creation of the International Planned Parenthood Federation. It was formed in nineteen fifty two after an international conference in Bombay, India. Sanger was one of its first presidents.</p>
<p>The organization was aimed at increasing the acceptance of family planning around the world. Almost every country in the world is now a member of the international group.</p>
<p>SARAH LONG: Margaret Sanger lived to see the end of the Comstock Act and the invention of birth control medicine. She died in nineteen sixty-six in Tucson, Arizona. She was an important part of what has been called one of the most life-changing political movements of the Twentieth Century.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>

<p>SARAH LONG: And I’m Sarah Long. Join us again next week for another PEOPLE IN AMERICA program on the Voice of America.</p>

<p>This is IN THE NEWS in VOA Special English.</p>
<p>Burma is holding elections on Sunday. Voters will fill forty-five seats in elections for the national legislature or parliament.</p>
<p>This will be the first vote in the country since the end of almost fifty years of military rule. Yet the armed forces still have strong influence over the government.  One-fourth of the seats are for military appointees.</p>
<p>Burma’s legislature has four hundred forty seats in the lower house and a two hundred twenty-four seat Senate.</p>
<p>Two years ago, the Union Solidarity and Development Party won seventy-six percent of the vote in the most recent elections. Since then, the government has eased restrictions on the media and freed hundreds of political prisoners.</p>
<p>It also released the country’s most famous opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, from house arrest. These developments have led to positive reactions from western countries, including the United States. Late last year, Hillary Clinton became the first American Secretary of State to visit Burma in fifty years.</p>
<p>Aung Zaw is with the online newspaper, “The Irrawaddy.” He recently visited Burma after living in exile for twenty years. He says many Burmese are guarded about the reforms.</p>
<p>AUNG ZAW: “I find and discover a lot of very skeptical voices.  And people remain very, very, very, very, very skeptical about this reform process in our country.  A lot of people inside the country who speak Burmese, who read Burmese, who can communicate in our own language, don’t wear their rose-colored glasses.”</p>
<p>Burmese exiles have long been critical of Burma’s government.</p>
<p>The opposition National League for Democracy did not take part in elections two years ago. The party won parliamentary elections in nineteen ninety, but Burma’s rulers never recognized the results.</p>
<p>This year, party leader Aung San Suu Kyi is a candidate, and is expected to win a seat in the legislature. On Friday, the Nobel Peace Prize winner met with reporters and diplomats at her home in Rangoon. She said her party’s candidates faced threats and violence in the election campaign. And, she said the vote on Sunday cannot be called free and fair.</p>
<p>AUNG SAN SUU KYI: “I don’t think we can consider it a genuinely free and fair election if we take into consideration what has been going on for the last couple of months. But still, as we wish to work towards national reconciliation, we will try to tolerate what has happened. And we hope that the courage and resolution of the people will overcome the intimidations and other irregularities that have been taking place.”</p>
<p>Some observers say the recent changes in Burma will have a big effect. Reporter Thiha Saw says the vote will be an important test for the country.</p>
<p>THIHA SAW: “I watch it very closely because this will be something like a marker or a test about the sincerity of the regime. Are they going to make it really free and fair?  If it is going to be free and fair, the people in the western communities will start lifting the sanctions. So this is important for Burma as well as for the international community, too.”</p>
<p>Other observers are less hopeful for a fair vote, but say it will still be important. Burma’s government has invited observers from Asia, Australia, Canada, the European Union and the United States to witness the voting. Reporters from around the world are in Burma to report on the elections.</p>

<p>SUSAN CLARK: Now, the Special English program, AMERICAN STORIES.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>Our story today is called "Luck."  It was written by Mark Twain. Here is Shep O’Neal with the story.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>SHEP O’NEAL:  I was at a dinner in London given in honor of one of the most celebrated English military men of his time. I do not want to tell you his real name and titles. I will just call him Lieutenant General Lord Arthur Scoresby.</p>
<p>I cannot describe my excitement when I saw this great and famous man. There he sat, the man himself, in person, all covered with medals. I could not take my eyes off him. He seemed to show the true mark of greatness. His fame had no effect on him. The hundreds of eyes watching him, the worship of so many people did not seem to make any difference to him.</p>
<p>Next to me sat a clergyman, who was an old friend of mine. He was not always a clergyman. During the first half of his life he was a teacher in the military school at Woolwich. There was a strange look in his eye as he leaned toward me and whispered – “Privately – he is a complete fool.” He meant, of course, the hero of our dinner.</p>
<p>This came as a shock to me. I looked hard at him. I could not have been more surprised if he has said the same thing about Nepoleon, or Socrates, or Solomon. But I was sure of two things about the clergyman. He always spoke the truth. And, his judgment of men was good. Therefore, I wanted to find out more about our hero as soon as I could.</p>
<p>Some days later I got a chance to talk with the clergyman, and he told me more.  These are his exact words:</p>
<p>About forty years ago, I was an instructor in the military academy at Woolwich, when young Scoresby was given his first examination. I felt extremely sorry for him.  Everybody answered the questions well, intelligently, while he – why, dear me – he did not know anything, so to speak. He was a nice, pleasant young man. It was painful to see him stand there and give answers that were miracles of stupidity.</p>
<p>I knew of course that when examined again he would fail and be thrown out. So, I said to myself, it would be a simple, harmless act to help him as much as I could.</p>
<p>I took him aside and found he knew a little about Julius Ceasar’s history. But, he did not know anything else. So, I went to work and tested him and worked him like a slave. I made him work, over and over again, on a few questions about Ceasar, which I knew he would be asked.</p>
<p>If you will believe me, he came through very well on the day of the examination.  He got high praise too, while others who knew a thousand times more than he were sharply criticized. By some strange, lucky accident, he was asked no questions but those I made him study. Such an accident does not happen more than once in a hundred years.</p>
<p>Well, all through his studies, I stood by him, with the feeling a mother has for a disabled child. And he always saved himself by some miracle.</p>
<p>I thought that what in the end would destroy him would be the mathematics examination.  I decided to make his end as painless as possible. So, I pushed facts into his stupid head for hours. Finally, I let him go to the examination to experience what I was sure would be his dismissal from school. Well, sir, try to imagine the result. I was shocked out of my mind. He took first prize! And he got the highest praise.</p>
<p>I felt guilty day and night – what I was doing was not right. But I only wanted to make his dismissal a little less painful for him. I never dreamed it would lead to such strange, laughable results.</p>
<p>I thought that sooner or later one thing was sure to happen: The first real test once he was through school would ruin him.</p>
<p>Then, the Crimean War broke out. I felt that sad for him that there had to be a war.  Peace would have given this donkey a chance to escape from ever being found out as being so stupid. Nervously, I waited for the worst to happen. It did. He was appointed an officer.  A captain, of all things! Who could have dreamed that they would place such a responsibility on such weak shoulders as his.</p>
<p>I said to myself that I was responsible to the country for this. I must go with him and protect the nation against him as far as I could. So, I joined up with him. And anyway we went to the field.</p>
<p>And there – oh dear, it was terrible. Mistakes, fearful mistakes – why, he never did anything that was right – nothing but mistakes. But, you see, nobody knew the secret of how stupid he really was. Everybody misunderstood his actions. They saw his stupid mistakes as works of great intelligence. They did, honestly!</p>
<p>His smallest mistakes made a man in his right mind cry, and shout and scream too – to himself, of course. And what kept me in a continual fear was the fact that every mistake he made increased his glory and fame. I kept saying to myself that when at last they found out about him, it will be like the sun falling out of the sky.</p>
<p>He continued to climb up, over the dead bodies of his superiors. Then, in the hottest moment of one battle down went our colonel. My heart jumped into my mouth, for Scoresby was the next in line to take his place. Now, we are in for it, I said…</p>
<p>The battle grew hotter. The English and their allies were steadily retreating all over the field. Our regiment occupied a position that was extremely important. One mistake now would bring total disaster. And what did Scoresby do this time – he just mistook his left hand for his right hand…that was all. An order came for him to fall back and support our right. Instead, he moved forward and went over the hill to the left. We were over the hill before this insane movement could be discovered and stopped. And what did we find? A large and unsuspected Russian army waiting! And what happened – were we all killed? That is exactly what would have happened in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred.  But no – those surprised Russians thought that no one regiment by itself would come around there at such a time.</p>
<p>It must be the whole British army, they thought. They turned tail, away they went over the hill and down into the field in wild disorder, and we after them. In no time, there was the greatest turn around you ever saw. The allies turned defeat into a sweeping and shining victory.</p>
<p>The allied commander looked on, his head spinning with wonder, surprise and joy.  He sent right off for Scoresby, and put his arms around him and hugged him on the field in front of all the armies. Scoresby became famous that day as a great military leader – honored throughout the world. That honor will never disappear while history books last.</p>
<p>He is just as nice and pleasant as ever, but he still does not know enough to come in out of the rain. He is the stupidest man in the universe.</p>
<p>Until now, nobody knew it but Scoresby and myself. He has been followed, day by day, year by year, by a strange luck. He has been a shining soldier in all our wars for years.  He has filled his whole military life with mistakes. Every one of them brought him another honorary title. Look at his chest, flooded with British and foreign medals. Well, sir, every one of them is the record of some great stupidity or other. They are proof that the best thing that can happen to a man is to be born lucky. I say again, as I did at the dinner, Scoresby’s a complete fool.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>SUSAN CLARK: You have just heard the story "Luck."  It was written by Mark Twain and adapted for Special English by Harold Berman. Your narrator was Shep O’Neal.  Listen again next week at this same time for another American Story told in Special English on the Voice of America. This is Susan Clark.</p>

<p>JUNE SIMMS: Welcome to AMERICAN MOSAIC in VOA Special English.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>I’m June Simms. On the program today, we play new music from Justin Townes Earle…</p>
<p>And we return to a story about the sale of shares in a company that operates a famous New York skyscraper…</p>
<p>But first, we go play games at an art show in Washington…</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p><strong>“The Art of Video Games”</strong></p>
<p>JUNE SIMMS: Most art exhibits have a no-touch policy. At the Smithsonian Institution, guards often give a warning if people position themselves too close to works of art. But, right now, the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American Art is inviting visitors to play with parts of its new exhibit, “The Art of Video Games.” Mario Ritter has our story.</p>
<p>MARIO RITTER: Six-year-old gamer Jacob Smith enjoys playing at the museum.</p>
<p>JACOB SMITH: “Awesome…”</p>
<p>Jacob was prepared to take a favorite video game he found there.</p>
<p>JACOB SMITH: “I was really excited. I think that you could buy games here. Like I have some money.”</p>
<iframe src="http://www.voanews.com/templates/widgetDisplay.html?id=143970946&amp;player=article" width="480" height="305"></iframe>
<p>But none of the eighty games are for sale. They all are on loan from Chris Melissinos, who set up the show.</p>
<p>CHRIS MELISSINOS: “Video games have been present in my life since as long as I can remember.”</p>
<p>Chris Melissinos sees video games as more than just play things. He suspects other people feel the same way.</p>
<p>CHRIS MELISSINOS: “I think many of us who grew up with these always knew them to be something more than what they seemed to be on the surface. Whether or not we considered them to be art may have just been from a lack of maturity.”</p>
<p>Video game creation usually starts with pencil-drawn images on paper. The show includes some of these for visitors to look at. The history of video game art is explored through pictures and video in one room of the exhibit. The beauty and complexity of modern video games are clear next to earlier games like Pac-Man, which was developed thirty years ago in Japan.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting parts of modern gaming is the increasing involvement of the player. Chris Melissinos says that these days, the gamer really is in the game.</p>
<p>CHRIS MELISSINOS: “We see interactive storytelling that lets you guide the story along to make sure your included in the narrative.”</p>
<p>“Myst” was one of the earliest video games to present the story from the point of view of the gamer. “Myst” came out in the early nineteen-nineties. It is one of the five games that visitors can play with at the “Art of Video Games” show.</p>
<p>Thirty-two year old Brad Pittack says the exhibit was a trip back in time for him.</p>
<p>BRAD PITTACK: “It brings back memories from growing up to see some of the games.”</p>
<p>Brad Pittack also enjoyed playing a new game called “Flower.” It creates the feeling one is floating through the air, like a flower petal on the wind. He says the experience was calming, unlike most video games.</p>
<p>“The Art of Video Games” will continue as the most playful exhibit in Washington through the spring and summer. The show at the National Museum of American Art closes on September thirtieth.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Empire State Building Update</strong></p>
<p>JUNE SIMMS: We have new information about a report we presented last December. At that time, we talked about the Empire State Building in New York City. We reported on plans by its owner to sell shares in a publicly-traded company that would operate the world-famous structure.  Here is Christopher Cruise with an update on our story.</p>
<p>CHRISTOPHER CRUISE: The Empire State Building has one hundred two floors. It was the tallest building in the world for more than forty years – from nineteen thirty-one to nineteen seventy-two. While it is no longer the tallest, people from around the world visit its eighty-sixth floor observatory to see New York from high above. The observatory is one of the city’s most-popular tourist attractions.</p>
<p>Recently, the company that owns the building said it is moving forward with plans to sell one billion dollars in shares in what is called an IPO, or initial public offering. Two classes of stock are to be offered. Class “A” shares will be sold to the public. Each Class “A” share is worth one vote. Class “B” shares will be sold to the Malkin family, which controls the company. Each Class “B” stock will hold fifty votes a share.</p>
<p>The Malkin family has spent almost five hundred million dollars fixing and modernizing the Empire State Building. The family said it plans to spend hundreds of millions of dollars more on the building and some of the other structures it owns. The money would come from the stock offering.</p>
<p>At least two groups of investors have taken legal action in an effort to block the offering. The Reuters news agency reported earlier this month that one group says the IPO awards too much of the value of the underlying properties to the Malkins. It says the family would control too much of the new company.</p>
<p>Unless a judge agrees to stop the IPO, shares should go on sale later this month. If that happens, many people will be able to say they are part-owners of the Empire State Building.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p><strong>Justin Townes Earle</strong></p>
<p>JUNE SIMMS: “Nothing’s Gonna Change the Way You Feel About Me Now,” is the latest album from Justin Townes Earle. He recorded his fourth album in only four days. Yet somehow he has created a timeless sound in this exploration of love, loss, rescue and recovery.</p>
<p><span class="margin-bottom-small display-block container field-note">&lt;!--IMAGE-LEFT--&gt;</span>Justin Townes Earle is the son of Grammy Award winning musician Steve Earle. And like his father, he has had a history of drug problems. The younger Earle’s drug abuse began when he was still a boy. He has been in several recovery programs as an adult. His struggle is expressed in some of the songs on the new album, including “Look the Other Way.”</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>Justin Townes Earle also sings about love. “Baby’s Got A Bad Idea” is about a man who suspects his woman might be keeping a secret from him. But the song is not sad. It has a rock and roll, energetic dance sound.</p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>On “Maria” Justin Townes Earle sounds sad and surprised at the loss of love. He sings: <em>It used to be I was the object of affection/ In your eyes alone/But now it seems your heart has found a new direction/And you’re leaving me out in the cold.</em></p>
<p>(MUSIC)</p>
<p>Justin Townes Earle grew up in Nashville, Tennessee – a city often called the home of Country Music. The thirty year old now lives in New York City. We leave you with a song about the neighborhood he lives in. Here is Justin Townes Earle performing “Lower East Side” from his new album, “Nothing’s Gonna Change the Way You Feel About Me Now.”</p>
